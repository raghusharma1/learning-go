ROOST_METHOD_HASH=mod_77660bb85f
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=mod_10abfc4edf

Scenario 1: Modulo Operation with Positive Integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the standard functionality of the mod function when both parameters are positive integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with two positive integers.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is the remainder of the first integer divided by the second.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the standard mathematical operation of modulo. The importance of this test is to validate the core functionality of the mod function.

Scenario 2: Modulo Operation with Negative Integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the mod function when both parameters are negative integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with two negative integers.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is the remainder of the first integer divided by the second, minus the second integer.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the specific behavior of the mod function when both parameters are negative. This test is important to ensure the function handles negative integers correctly.

Scenario 3: Modulo Operation with Mixed Integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the mod function when the parameters are a mix of negative and positive integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with a negative first integer and a positive second integer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is the remainder of the first integer divided by the second, plus the second integer.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the specific behavior of the mod function when the parameters are mixed. This test is important to ensure the function handles mixed integers correctly.

Scenario 4: Modulo Operation with Zero

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the mod function when one of the parameters is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with a non-zero integer and zero.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the function returns an error or panics, as division by zero is undefined.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the undefined behavior of division by zero. This test is important to ensure the function handles such cases correctly and does not produce unexpected results.
