Scenario 1: Test with Power of Two Number

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies a number that is a power of two.
Execution:
Arrange: No setup required.
Act: Invoke the isPowerOfTwoBitwise function with a number that is a power of two (for example, 4).
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
The function should return true because 4 is a power of two. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies numbers that are powers of two.

Scenario 2: Test with Non-Power of Two Number

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies a number that is not a power of two.
Execution:
Arrange: No setup required.
Act: Invoke the isPowerOfTwoBitwise function with a number that is not a power of two (for example, 6).
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
The function should return false because 6 is not a power of two. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies numbers that are not powers of two.

Scenario 3: Test with Negative Number

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies a negative number.
Execution:
Arrange: No setup required.
Act: Invoke the isPowerOfTwoBitwise function with a negative number (for example, -2).
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
The function should return false because -2 is a negative number and negative numbers can never be a power of two. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies negative numbers.

Scenario 4: Test with Zero

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies zero.
Execution:
Arrange: No setup required.
Act: Invoke the isPowerOfTwoBitwise function with zero.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
The function should return true because zero is considered as a power of two in this function. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies zero as a power of two.

This test function "TestIsPowerOfTwoBitwise" is using table-driven tests to verify the correctness of the function "isPowerOfTwoBitwise". The test data is defined in a slice of anonymous struct, each item in the slice is a test case with input and expected output. The function "isPowerOfTwoBitwise" is called with the input from each test case, and the result is compared with the expected output. If they are not equal, an error message is printed.
