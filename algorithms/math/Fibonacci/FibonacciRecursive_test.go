ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=FibonacciRecursive_6a9d243a0e

Scenario 1: Fibonacci Recursive for n=0
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is 0. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the result should be 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with parameter 0.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. This test is important to verify that the function correctly handles the edge case when the input parameter is 0.

Scenario 2: Fibonacci Recursive for n=1
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is 1. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the result should be 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with parameter 1.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is 1.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. This test is important to verify that the function correctly handles the edge case when the input parameter is 1.

Scenario 3: Fibonacci Recursive for n>1
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is greater than 1. The function should correctly calculate the Fibonacci number for the given input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with a parameter greater than 1.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is the correct Fibonacci number for the given input.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. This test is important to verify that the function correctly calculates the Fibonacci number for inputs greater than 1.

Scenario 4: Fibonacci Recursive for n<0
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is less than 0. The function should return a value of 0 since the Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with a parameter less than 0.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. This test is important to verify that the function correctly handles edge cases when the input parameter is less than 0.
