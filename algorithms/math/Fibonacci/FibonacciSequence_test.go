ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=fibonacciSequence_bf4aa71a9c

Scenario 1: Test with a positive integer
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly returns the Fibonacci sequence for a given positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function with a positive integer, say 5.
  Assert: Verify that the output matches the expected Fibonacci sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 5th number. This test is important to ensure that the function works as expected with normal input.

Scenario 2: Test with zero
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles the edge case where the input is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function with zero as the input.
  Assert: Verify that the output is an array with a single element [0].
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly handles the edge case where the input is zero. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when given an input of zero.

Scenario 3: Test with a negative integer
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles a negative integer input. Since the Fibonacci sequence is defined only for non-negative integers, the function should return an empty array.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function with a negative integer, say -3.
  Assert: Verify that the output is an empty array.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly handles negative integers by returning an empty array. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when given a negative integer.

Scenario 4: Test with a large integer
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can handle large integer inputs without running into performance issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function with a large integer, say 1000.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an array of the correct length.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function can handle large inputs by checking the length of the returned array. This test is important to ensure that the function is optimized and can handle large inputs without performance degradation.

Scenario 5: Test for correct sequence
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function returns the correct Fibonacci sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function with an integer, say 6.
  Assert: Verify that the output matches the expected Fibonacci sequence [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8].
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly calculates the Fibonacci sequence. This test is important to ensure that the function works as expected and returns the correct sequence.
