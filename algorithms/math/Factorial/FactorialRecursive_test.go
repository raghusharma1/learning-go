Test Cases:
    [TestRecusriveFactorial]

```
Scenario 1: Factorial of a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles negative input correctly, as factorials are not defined for negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the input with a negative integer, such as -5.
    Act: Call the FactorialRecursive function with this negative integer.
    Assert: Verify that the function handles this input appropriately, potentially by returning an error or a defined sentinel value.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    Discuss the importance of handling negative input to prevent logical errors or infinite recursion within the function.

Scenario 2: Factorial of a Large Number

Details:
  Description: This test aims to check the function's behavior when calculating the factorial of a large number, which can result in integer overflow.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the input using a relatively large integer, such as 20 or greater, depending on the integer limits.
    Act: Invoke the FactorialRecursive function with the large integer.
    Assert: Use assertions to verify whether the function handles potential overflow correctly or produces the expected result.
  Validation:
    Explain that the expected result should account for integer overflow, which may necessitate other handling mechanisms if using native int types.
    Highlight the importance of understanding the capacity limits of data types in different architectures and systems.

Scenario 3: Factorial of 1

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly computes the factorial of 1, which should return 1.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the input with the integer 1.
    Act: Execute the FactorialRecursive function with this input.
    Assert: Confirm that the result equals 1, as 1! equals 1.
  Validation:
    Establish the logic that the factorial of 1 is a base case, fundamental to ensuring correctness in the recursive structure.
    Emphasize that this test confirms correct handling of the smallest positive factorial.

Scenario 4: Check for Function Stability Exceeding Maximum Stack Depth

Details:
  Description: This test examines how the function behaves under inputs that might exceed the stack's capacity due to deep recursion.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Choose a very large integer that could potentially cause a stack overflow or exceed recursion depth limits.
    Act: Execute the FactorialRecursive function with this risky input.
    Assert: Catch and assess if the system throws an appropriate runtime error (or provide recommendations if applicable).
  Validation:
    Explain the significance of managing stack depth in recursive functions and the potential need for iterative solutions or improved error handling.

Scenario 5: Factorial of a Floating Point Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test ensures handling when the input could be mistakenly passed as a floating-point number, needing a check for type correctness.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Hypothetically handle a case where the input post conversion could appear similar, e.g., 5.0.
    Act: Use the integer part of the number only if received as a float (by conversion).
    Assert: Verify that the function processes only integer input and checks this precondition.
  Validation:
    Highlight the necessity of input validation and correctness to maintain standard operation of integer-based calculations.
    Discuss validation to prevent unintended behavior due to incorrect data types being passed to the function.
```

These scenarios aim to cover various input cases and potential issues with the FactorialRecursive function, ensuring robust and accurate functionality within expected and unexpected conditions.
