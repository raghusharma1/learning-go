Here's a set of test scenarios for the `FactorialRecursive` function, considering various aspects like normal operation, edge cases, and unexpected conditions:

### Scenario 1: Factorial of a Positive Number Less Than 5

**Details:**

- **Description:** This test checks that factorial calculations are performed correctly for a small positive integer (e.g., `3`), which is a common baseline case.

**Execution:**

- **Arrange:** Prepare the integer input `3`.
- **Act:** Call `FactorialRecursive(3)`.
- **Assert:** Verify the result is `6`, which is `3!`.

**Validation:**

- The assertion checks that small positive integers are computed accurately, standard functionality for a factorial function. Testing smaller numbers ensures correctness without deep recursion.

### Scenario 2: Factorial of a Larger Positive Number

**Details:**

- **Description:** Validate the calculation for a larger positive integer input like `12`, to confirm the function's ability to handle deeper recursion and larger numbers.

**Execution:**

- **Arrange:** Prepare the integer input `12`.
- **Act:** Call `FactorialRecursive(12)`.
- **Assert:** Verify the result is `479001600`, which is `12!`.

**Validation:**

- Asserting for larger numbers ensures recursion depth and multiplication logic are robust, handling real-world larger input expectations.

### Scenario 3: Factorial of 1

**Details:**

- **Description:** Ensure the function correctly handles the edge case where input is `1`, testing the simplest non-zero factorial.

**Execution:**

- **Arrange:** Set up with `1` as input.
- **Act:** Invoke `FactorialRecursive(1)`.
- **Assert:** Confirm the result is `1`.

**Validation:**

- Validating `1!` holds its identity as `1` checks the base case logic beyond zero correctly defined.

### Scenario 4: Factorial of a Negative Number

**Details:**

- **Description:** Test the function's response to a negative number (such as `-3`), an unexpected input scenario for factorial.

**Execution:**

- **Arrange:** Provide `-3` as input.
- **Act:** Call `FactorialRecursive(-3)`.
- **Assert:** Determine if error handling is in place (modification needed as original code lacks this).

**Validation:**

- Important to discuss potential undefined results for negative inputs in a real application, likely requiring code changes. The test highlights the need for logic/range validation.

### Scenario 5: Factorial with Maximum Integer Before Overflow

**Details:**

- **Description:** Determine the function's handling at the edge of integer overflow, validating performance and safety when inputs approach safe compute limits.

**Execution:**

- **Arrange:** Use a number such as `15`, or adjust based on safe limitation tests.
- **Act:** Execute `FactorialRecursive(15)`.
- **Assert:** Confirm the computation finishes without overflow.

**Validation:**

- This test is critical for applications performing intensive math, ensuring no unwanted wrapping or overflows at application-level maximums.

These scenarios aim to thoroughly evaluate the correctness and reliability of the `FactorialRecursive` function across regular and exceptional conditions. Further tests could handle implementation-specific error-handling once the range check is completed.
