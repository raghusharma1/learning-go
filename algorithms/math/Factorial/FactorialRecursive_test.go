Test Cases:
    [TestRecusriveFactorial]

```
Scenario 1: Factorial of 1

Details:
  Description: This test checks the base case for factorial calculation with the input of 1, which should return 1. This is to ensure the function handles the simplest positive integer input correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an input variable with the value 1.
  Act: Invoke the `FactorialRecursive` function with the input value.
  Assert: Verify the result is equal to 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    - Assert that the result equals 1 because by definition, 1! = 1.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
    - Validating that the function correctly handles the smallest positive factorial is crucial for recursive logic correctness.

Scenario 2: Factorial of a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when given a negative number as input, expecting a decision on handling errors or unexpected results, like returning 1 or 0 if not specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an input variable with a negative value, such as -5.
  Act: Call the `FactorialRecursive` function with the negative input.
  Assert: Check the result to see how it handles unexpected input.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    - Depending on function design, assert an error code, panic recovery, or default value; for many factorial implementations, a common approach is to return 1 when negative inputs are unexpected.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
    - Handling negative inputs is important for the robustness of numerical and mathematical computations offered by the application.

Scenario 3: Factorial of a Large Number Beyond Usual Boundaries

Details:
  Description: This test examines the function's performance and correctness when inputting a large number that could lead to integer overflow, which is a real risk in recursive calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a large value such as 20 or higher, based on 32-bit integer limits.
  Act: Call `FactorialRecursive` with this large input value.
  Assert: Verify whether the function either calculates correctly, handles overflow, or specifies it non-crashing.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    - Assert the correctness using pre-calculated values for specific large inputs, but also method to handle or errors if overflow occurs.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
    - Ensuring the application's mathematical functions have integrity can prevent system and application errors that might lead to crashes or incorrect computation.

Scenario 4: Factorial of a Typical Small Positive Number (3)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's accuracy for a typical, small positive integer, ensuring the factorial calculation produces the expected result based on known mathematics.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set input value to 3.
  Act: Call `FactorialRecursive` with the input.
  Assert: Ensure the output is equal to 6.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    - Assert result of 6, since 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
    - Tests on typical small cases ensure the correctness of the function for common numerous usages in practical applications.

Scenario 5: Factorial of a Number Near Integer Overflow (e.g., 12 for 4-byte integers)

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function can compute the factorial for numbers close to the maximum allowed by 4-byte integers, probing system limits.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set input to 12, the edge for 32-bit based overflow.
  Act: Invoke the `FactorialRecursive` function.
  Assert: Check that the result matches 479001600 when within bounds.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    - Proper use of limits using pre-calculated factorial results ensures answers match function-representing scopes.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
    - Results are linked to handling boundary conditions effectively to provide stable software performance and prevent computational errors.
