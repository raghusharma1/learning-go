Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/Factorial/Factorial_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestFactorial]

Here are several test scenarios for the `Factorial` function that avoid duplicating the test cases already provided:

```
Scenario 1: Factorial of a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the Factorial function handles negative input values, which do not have a mathematically defined factorial.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative integer as the input for the factorial function.
  Act: Call Factorial(-5).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a defined behavior, such as 1 or an error.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: As negative numbers don't have a factorial, the function should gracefully handle this case, either by returning a specific value or triggering an error.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: It's crucial to ensure that the function can handle edge cases and incorrect inputs without failing unpredictably.

Scenario 2: Factorial of 1

Details:
  Description: This test checks the correctness of the Factorial function when dealing with the smallest positive integer input, which is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use 1 as the input value for the factorial function.
  Act: Call Factorial(1).
  Assert: Check that the result is 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The factorial of 1 is mathematically defined as 1, which serves as a basic sanity check for the function's logic.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that the base case of the factorial calculation is handled correctly, which is foundational for recursive or iterative factorial implementations.

Scenario 3: Factorial of a Large Positive Number

Details:
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function handles large input values and assesses the performance and potential overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a large integer, such as 20, which is within the reasonable range to avoid overflow in Go.
  Act: Call Factorial(20).
  Assert: Ensure that the result is 2432902008176640000.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Verify that the function can compute larger factorials correctly, given Go's integer limit.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Testing with larger numbers helps identify potential performance bottlenecks or overflow issues in application logic.

Scenario 4: Factorial of a Very Large Number (Boundary Testing)

Details:
  Description: This test is designed for boundary testing to identify integer overflow issues when calculating factorials.
Execution:
  Arrange: Determine a boundary number close to the integer overflow limit, such as Factorial(21) for `int`.
  Act: Call Factorial(21).
  Assert: Check the result for unexpected values, potentially custom error handling or a character beyond integer limits.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Given the overflow behavior of integers in Go, this test examines how Factorial behaves at or near its arithmetic limits.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application behavior or business requirements: Testing integer overflow can prevent silent failures or undefined behaviors in production environments.

Scenario 5: Factorial of 2

Details:
  Description: A straightforward test case ensuring that the factorial function calculates smaller integers like 2 correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 2 as input.
  Act: Call Factorial(2).
  Assert: Check that the result equals 2.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: This ensures correctness for basic multiplication cases, crucial for confirming the function's algorithm.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures small value accuracy before tackling more complex calculations.

Scenario 6: Factorial of 11

Details:
  Description: This test adds a value just beyond a common manual testing threshold to ensure the function performs for mid-range values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use 11 as the input value.
  Act: Call Factorial(11).
  Assert: Confirm the result is 39916800.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Validate that the function can compute factors correctly, reinforcing confidence in mid-range calculations.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures robustness across a slightly larger range, potentially useful in many mathematical or scientific computations where factorials are common.
``` 

These scenarios provide a comprehensive assessment of the factorial function, covering both standard and edge cases. The tests ensure reliability, mathematical correctness, and application resilience for a variety of input conditions.
