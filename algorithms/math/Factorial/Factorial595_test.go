Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/Factorial/Factorial_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestFactorial]

Here are several test scenarios for the `Factorial` function, designed to cover various cases beyond those already tested:

---

**Scenario 1: Factorial of 1**

Details:
- **Description**: Verify that the factorial function correctly calculates the factorial for the smallest positive integer, where the result should match the identity property of multiplication (1 factorial = 1).

Execution:
- **Arrange**: Prepare the input value as 1.
- **Act**: Call the `Factorial` function with the input value.
- **Assert**: Check that the output is 1.

Validation:
- **Explain the choice of assertion**: Since 1! is always 1, this test validates the simplest base case after 0. The expected result is straightforward and known.
- **Discuss the importance**: This case is significant to ensure that the function handles the minimal non-zero input correctly, supporting confidence in other factorial calculations.

---

**Scenario 2: Factorial of a Negative Number**

Details:
- **Description**: Examine how the function handles negative inputs, which mathematically do not have a factorial. Ideally, it should either return a specific value or error appropriately.

Execution:
- **Arrange**: Choose a negative number, such as -1.
- **Act**: Pass the negative number to the `Factorial` function.
- **Assert**: Determine if the function returns a logical default value or handles an error gracefully.

Validation:
- **Explain the choice of assertion**: Since factorials for negative numbers are undefined, this test checks program robustness and how it handles unexpected inputs.
- **Discuss the importance**: Ensuring graceful handling of invalid inputs is crucial in real-world applications to prevent failures or undefined behaviors.

---

**Scenario 3: Factorial of a Large Number**

Details:
- **Description**: Test the ability of the function to compute large factorials, checking for potential overflow or performance issues.

Execution:
- **Arrange**: Select a large input number, such as 20 or 50.
- **Act**: Invoke the `Factorial` function with this input.
- **Assert**: Compare the result with the known correct factorial value or examine if the computed value aligns with expected limitations (like max integer size).

Validation:
- **Explain the choice of assertion**: Large number calculations can expose limitations in data types (e.g., int overflow), crucial for applications requiring large computations.
- **Discuss the importance**: This validates the function’s limits and its behavior with large datasets, which is vital in performance-sensitive systems.

---

**Scenario 4: Factorial of a Non-integer Float Type (should be invalid as per int input)**

Details:
- **Description**: While the function signature specifies an integer input, this test anticipates behavior if a developer mistakenly modifies the signature to accept floating-point numbers.

Execution:
- **Arrange**: Hypothetical testing with a float type input like 5.5.
- **Act**: Execute `Factorial` with the float type.
- **Assert**: Anticipate an outcome that clarifies type conflicts or enforces integer-only inputs.

Validation:
- **Explain the choice of assertion**: It’s a proactive examination ensuring function integrity if future adjustments change input types.
- **Discuss the importance**: Upholds the principle of correct type safety and consistency within the application, avoiding logic errors.

---

These scenarios aim to challenge the `Factorial` implementation on various fronts, building confidence in its reliability across different input conditions and potential errors.
