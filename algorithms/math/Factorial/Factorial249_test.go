Test Cases:
    [TestFactorial]

```markdown
Scenario 1: Factorial of 1

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the calculation of the factorial for the smallest positive integer, which is a base case scenario typically expected to return 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare to pass the integer 1 as input to the Factorial function.
  Act: Invoke the `Factorial` function using 1 as the input parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the result returned by the function is 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. In mathematics, the factorial of 1 is 1, making this a critical base case ensuring the function handles the simplest factorial correctly.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Validating this edge case is important to establish the function's correctness for the minimal input, ensuring all integer values return accurate results.

Scenario 2: Factorial of a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: Test how the function handles a negative input, which generally does not have a factorial definition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare to pass a negative integer, e.g., -5, as input to the Factorial function.
  Act: Call the `Factorial` function with -5 as the argument.
  Assert: Check whether the function returns an appropriate response, potentially an error value or zero.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Negative values typically do not have a factorial, so the function should account for this edge case either by returning a default response like 1 or another recognizable indicator.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Handling unexpected inputs like negatives ensures robustness, potentially prompting error handling or documentation updates if not already defined in function behavior.

Scenario 3: Factorial of Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: Evaluate the function's performance and ability to handle computing large factorials without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Consider using a large number, such as 20, as input for the Factorial function.
  Act: Call the `Factorial` function with 20 as the input.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct factorial value: 2432902008176640000.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Large factorial values, such as 20!, are often used to assess the function's numerical stability and handling of potential integer overflow.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Ensuring that the function handles large inputs correctly is essential for applications that utilize large number computations, avoiding incorrect calculations or crashes.

Scenario 4: Factorial of Maximum Int Value Handling

Details:
  Description: Test the function's capability to handle the maximum allowable integer input for its environment.
Execution:
  Arrange: Determine the maximum int value supported by the system, typically found in constants like math.MaxInt32.
  Act: Call the `Factorial` function with this maximum int value as an input.
  Assert: Ensure the function behaves predictably, whether through a specific return value, runtime error, or preemptive limitation handling.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. The factorial of such a large number exceeds the capacity of standard integer types, making it important to understand function limitations and the response to such inputs.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Defining the behavior for maximum input sizes prevents unexpected errors, particularly in applications requiring high precision calculations or interfacing with user inputs.
``` 

These test scenarios aim to cover various aspects of the function's expected operation, from typical values to edge cases, ensuring robust validation of its implementation.
