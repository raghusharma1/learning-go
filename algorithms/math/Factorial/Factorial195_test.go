Test Cases:
    [TestFactorial]

To generate comprehensive test scenarios for the `Factorial` function, we will consider different cases including normal operation, edge cases, and aspects such as performance and potential overflow. Here are the potential test scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Factorial of Negative Number
  **Details:**
  - Description: This test checks the behavior when the input is a negative integer, which is not defined for factorial.
  
  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare a negative input value, e.g., -5.
  - Act: Call `Factorial(-5)`.
  - Assert: Check that the function handles this gracefully, possibly returning an error or a specific value to indicate invalid input.
  
  **Validation:**
  - Choosing a negative value validates the function doesn't incorrectly attempt to multiply in the loop, ensuring robustness against invalid input.
  - This is crucial to avoid unexpected logical errors during runtime that could affect calculations in a larger application.

### Scenario 2: Factorial of 1
  **Details:**
  - Description: Ensures the factorial of 1, which should simply return 1, is computed correctly.
  
  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Set input to 1.
  - Act: Invoke `Factorial(1)`.
  - Assert: Confirm the output is exactly 1.
  
  **Validation:**
  - This basic test confirms that the function can handle edge cases at the lower bounds and doesn't perform unnecessary calculations.
  - It validates correctness in handling the simplest non-zero input, a cornerstone for recursive or iterative factorial calculations.

### Scenario 3: Factorial of a Large Number (Boundary Test)
  **Details:**
  - Description: Tests the function with a large number, like 20, to ensure it correctly handles larger inputs and verifies it does not overflow the integer.

  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Set a relatively large input, such as 20.
  - Act: Invoke `Factorial(20)`.
  - Assert: Confirm the calculated factorial matches the expected result, 2,432,902,008,176,640,000.

  **Validation:**
  - This scenario tests both performance and correctness, checking if the implementation can handle extensive iterative operations.
  - Ensures integer bounds are respected to avoid overflow, which could lead to incorrect financial computations or scientific calculations.

### Scenario 4: Factorial Function Handling of Type Limits
  **Details:**
  - Description: Test the function's behavior when input is close to the limit of integer handling to assess potential overflow-free safety.

  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Choose a boundary limit, such as 1 less than maximum input safely computed without overflow (based on system).
  - Act: Call `Factorial(12)` (as 12! is often a safe limit for 32-bit integers).
  - Assert: Expect result without any overflow.
  
  **Validation:**
  - By pushing the limits of input size, this test ensures the factorial calculation does not exceed variable storage capacity, protecting against memory corruption or unintended behavior.

### Scenario 5: Factorial Function with Special Input (Zero)
  **Details:**
  - Description: Verifies that the factorial of zero, should always return 1, consistent with the mathematical definition.
  
  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare the input `0`.
  - Act: Call `Factorial(0)`.
  - Assert: Validate that the result is `1`.
  
  **Validation:**
  - Zero as input serves as a mathematical base case; ensuring it's handled correctly prevents compounding errors in more complex recursive computations in business processes or scientific models.

These test scenarios explore different angles of the factorial function, from validation with typical and edge cases to ensuring proper handling of datatype limits within practical computational constraints. This suite solidifies confidence in the function's readiness for diverse use cases in real-world applications.
