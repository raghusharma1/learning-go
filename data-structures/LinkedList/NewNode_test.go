### Scenario 1: Create a Node with a Positive Integer Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `NewNode` function correctly creates a new node with a positive integer value. The test will ensure that the `val` field is set correctly and that `next` and `prev` pointers are initialized to `nil`.
  Execution:
    - **Arrange**: Set up the integer value to be passed to the `NewNode` function (e.g., `val = 42`).
    - **Act**: Call the `NewNode` function with the positive integer `42`.
    - **Assert**: Verify that the returned node's `val` is `42`, and both `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - The assertion checks that the node's value is set correctly and that the pointers are initialized to `nil`.
    - This test is important as it ensures the basic functionality of creating a node with a valid integer value.

---

### Scenario 2: Create a Node with a Negative Integer Value

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that `NewNode` can handle negative integer values as input. The test ensures that the `val` field is correctly set to the negative number and that the `next` and `prev` fields are initialized to `nil`.
  Execution:
    - **Arrange**: Set up the integer value to be passed to the `NewNode` function (e.g., `val = -100`).
    - **Act**: Call the `NewNode` function with the negative integer `-100`.
    - **Assert**: Verify that the returned node's `val` is `-100`, and both `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - The assertion confirms that the function can handle negative values and that the node's value is correctly assigned.
    - This test is critical because it ensures the function's robustness when dealing with negative numbers, which may be used in certain applications.

---

### Scenario 3: Create a Node with Zero as the Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `NewNode` function handles zero as a valid input and correctly initializes the node. It ensures that the `val` field is set to `0` and that the `next` and `prev` pointers are initialized to `nil`.
  Execution:
    - **Arrange**: Set up the integer value to be passed to the `NewNode` function (e.g., `val = 0`).
    - **Act**: Call the `NewNode` function with the integer `0`.
    - **Assert**: Verify that the returned node's `val` is `0`, and both `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - The assertion ensures that zero is a valid value for the node and that the function correctly handles it.
    - This test is significant because zero is often a boundary value in programming, and the function should handle it appropriately.

---

### Scenario 4: Ensure `next` and `prev` are Initialized to `nil`

Details:
  Description: This test specifically checks that the `next` and `prev` pointers of a newly created node are initialized to `nil`. It ensures that a newly created node is not linked to any other nodes.
  Execution:
    - **Arrange**: Set up any integer value (e.g., `val = 10`).
    - **Act**: Call the `NewNode` function with the integer `10`.
    - **Assert**: Verify that both the `next` and `prev` fields of the returned node are set to `nil`.
  Validation:
    - The assertion ensures that the node is created in isolation and is not linked to any other nodes.
    - This test is important because it guarantees that the node starts in a standalone state, which is a critical condition for building linked lists.

---

### Scenario 5: Create Multiple Nodes with Different Values

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `NewNode` function can create multiple independent nodes with different values. It ensures that each node is initialized correctly and that the values of the nodes do not interfere with one another.
  Execution:
    - **Arrange**: Set up multiple integer values (e.g., `10`, `20`, `30`).
    - **Act**: Call the `NewNode` function three times, passing each value in turn.
    - **Assert**: Verify that each node's `val` is initialized to the corresponding integer and that `next` and `prev` pointers are `nil` for all nodes.
  Validation:
    - The assertion ensures that each node is created independently and that their values are correctly assigned.
    - This test is crucial for linked list operations, where multiple nodes are created, and each node needs to maintain its own state.

---

### Scenario 6: Validate Node Creation in Concurrency

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `NewNode` function behaves correctly when invoked concurrently from multiple goroutines. It ensures that concurrent creation of nodes does not lead to race conditions or data corruption.
  Execution:
    - **Arrange**: Set up a slice of integer values (e.g., `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`).
    - **Act**: Call the `NewNode` function from multiple goroutines, each passing a different value from the slice.
    - **Assert**: Verify that each node is created correctly with the corresponding value and that `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - The assertion ensures that the function is thread-safe and does not produce race conditions when creating nodes concurrently.
    - This test is important for applications that may instantiate nodes in a concurrent environment, ensuring the function's correctness in multi-threaded use cases.

---

### Scenario 7: Check for Memory Address Uniqueness Between Nodes

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that each node created by the `NewNode` function has a unique memory address, verifying that the function does not return the same reference for different calls.
  Execution:
    - **Arrange**: Set up two different integer values (e.g., `5` and `10`).
    - **Act**: Call the `NewNode` function twice with the values `5` and `10`.
    - **Assert**: Verify that the memory addresses of the two returned nodes are different.
  Validation:
    - The assertion checks that each call to `NewNode` results in a unique node instance.
    - This test is important because in a linked list, each node must be a distinct object, and any shared references could lead to incorrect behavior.

---

### Scenario 8: Verify Node Creation with Large Integer Values

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `NewNode` function can handle large integer values without overflow or truncation. It ensures that the `val` field is correctly set to a large number.
  Execution:
    - **Arrange**: Set up a large integer value (e.g., `val = 1<<30`).
    - **Act**: Call the `NewNode` function with the large integer value.
    - **Assert**: Verify that the returned node's `val` is equal to the large integer value and that `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - The assertion ensures that large values are supported and handled correctly without any overflow.
    - This test is important for applications that deal with large datasets or calculations, ensuring that the function can handle large numbers.

---

### Scenario 9: Ensure Node's `next` and `prev` are Modifiable After Creation

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the `next` and `prev` pointers of a node can be modified after the node is created. This is essential for linking nodes in a linked list.
  Execution:
    - **Arrange**: Create two nodes using the `NewNode` function (e.g., `node1` and `node2`).
    - **Act**: Set `node1.next = node2` and `node2.prev = node1`.
    - **Assert**: Verify that `node1.next` points to `node2` and `node2.prev` points to `node1`.
  Validation:
    - The assertion checks that the pointers can be modified, which is crucial for building linked lists.
    - This test is significant because linked lists require the ability to link nodes dynamically after creation.

---

These test scenarios cover a wide range of cases, ensuring that the `NewNode` function behaves correctly under various conditions. Each test is designed to validate a specific aspect of the function's behavior, contributing to the overall reliability of the linked list implementation.
