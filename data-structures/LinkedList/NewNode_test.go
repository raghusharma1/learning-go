### Scenario 1: Create a Node with a Positive Integer Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `NewNode` function correctly creates a new node with a positive integer value. The test will ensure that the `val` field is set correctly and that both `next` and `prev` pointers are initialized to `nil`.
  Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare a positive integer value (e.g., `10`).
    - Act: Call the `NewNode` function with the provided integer value.
    - Assert: Verify that the returned node has a `val` equal to `10`, and both `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - The assertion ensures that the node's value is set correctly and that the pointers are initialized as expected. 
    - This test is important to confirm that the function works as intended for normal, valid inputs.

---

### Scenario 2: Create a Node with Zero Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `NewNode` function when the input value is `0`. It verifies whether the node is correctly initialized with a `val` of `0`, and both `next` and `prev` pointers are set to `nil`.
  Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare an integer value `0`.
    - Act: Call the `NewNode` function with the integer value `0`.
    - Assert: Verify that the returned node has a `val` equal to `0`, and both `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - The test ensures that the function can handle edge cases where the value is `0`, which is a valid input but may have unique behavior in some systems.

---

### Scenario 3: Create a Node with a Negative Integer Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `NewNode` function when a negative integer value is provided. The test will verify whether the node is correctly initialized with a negative value and that both `next` and `prev` pointers are `nil`.
  Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare a negative integer value (e.g., `-5`).
    - Act: Call the `NewNode` function with the provided integer value.
    - Assert: Verify that the returned node has a `val` equal to `-5`, and both `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - The assertion ensures that the function handles negative values correctly, which are valid inputs but could be problematic in some implementations.
    - This test is important to confirm that the function does not unintentionally reject or misinterpret negative numbers.

---

### Scenario 4: Verify that the `next` and `prev` Pointers are Initialized to `nil`

Details:
  Description: This test is specifically designed to check that both the `next` and `prev` pointers of the newly created node are initialized to `nil`. This ensures that the node is not accidentally linked to any other node upon creation.
  Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare any valid integer value (e.g., `1`).
    - Act: Call the `NewNode` function with the provided integer value.
    - Assert: Verify that both `next` and `prev` pointers in the returned node are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - This test is crucial because the `next` and `prev` pointers must be explicitly initialized to `nil` to avoid unexpected behavior in linked list operations.
    - Ensuring proper pointer initialization is critical for the integrity of a linked list structure.

---

### Scenario 5: Check for Proper Memory Allocation of the Node

Details:
  Description: This test verifies whether the `NewNode` function correctly allocates memory for the new node. The test will check whether the returned node is non-`nil`, ensuring that memory allocation has been successful.
  Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare any valid integer value (e.g., `42`).
    - Act: Call the `NewNode` function with the provided integer value.
    - Assert: Verify that the returned node is not `nil`.
  Validation:
    - This test is important to ensure that the function is allocating memory for the node properly. A `nil` node would indicate a failure in memory allocation, which could lead to runtime errors.

---

### Scenario 6: Stress Test with Large Integer Values

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the `NewNode` function can handle large integer values without any overflow or unexpected behavior. The test will verify that the node is correctly initialized with a large integer value.
  Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare a large integer value (e.g., `int(^uint(0) >> 1)` for the maximum possible integer value).
    - Act: Call the `NewNode` function with the large integer value.
    - Assert: Verify that the returned node has a `val` equal to the large integer value, and both `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - This test ensures that the function can handle large integer values, which is important for applications that may deal with large datasets or calculations.
    - It also checks for potential overflow issues that could arise in systems with limited integer ranges.

---

### Scenario 7: Stress Test with Very Small (Negative) Integer Values

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the `NewNode` function can handle very small (negative) integer values without any underflow or unexpected behavior. The test will verify that the node is correctly initialized with a very small integer value.
  Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare a very small integer value (e.g., `-int(^uint(0) >> 1) - 1` for the minimum possible integer value).
    - Act: Call the `NewNode` function with the very small integer value.
    - Assert: Verify that the returned node has a `val` equal to the very small integer value, and both `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - This test ensures that the function can handle very small (negative) integer values, which is important for applications dealing with extreme input values.
    - It also checks for potential underflow issues that could arise in systems with limited integer ranges.

---

### Scenario 8: Ensure Node Independence When Creating Multiple Nodes

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether multiple invocations of `NewNode` create independent nodes. Specifically, it ensures that the `next` and `prev` pointers of one node do not interfere with another node.
  Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare two integer values (e.g., `1` and `2`).
    - Act: Call `NewNode` twice with the two different values.
    - Assert: Verify that the `val`, `next`, and `prev` fields of both nodes are independent and correctly initialized.
  Validation:
    - This test is important to ensure that each node is created independently and does not share any internal state with other nodes, which is critical for maintaining the integrity of a linked list.

---

### Scenario 9: Test with Minimum Integer Value

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `NewNode` function can handle the minimum possible integer value in Go (`math.MinInt`), which is a valid input but could potentially cause issues in some implementations.
  Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare the minimum integer value (`math.MinInt`).
    - Act: Call the `NewNode` function with the minimum integer value.
    - Assert: Verify that the returned node has a `val` equal to `math.MinInt`, and both `next` and `prev` are `nil`.
  Validation:
    - This test ensures that the function can correctly handle the smallest possible integer value, which is important for applications dealing with extreme or boundary values.

---

By covering a wide array of scenarios, these test cases ensure that the `NewNode` function behaves correctly under normal, edge, and stress conditions. Each test is designed to validate a specific aspect of the function's behavior, ensuring reliable and predictable behavior in a linked list context.
