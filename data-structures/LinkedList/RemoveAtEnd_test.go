### Scenario 1: Removing from an Empty Linked List

Details:  
**Description**: This test checks the behavior of the `RemoveAtEnd` method when the linked list is empty. The function is expected to return `-1` when called on an empty list, as there are no elements to remove.  
**Execution**:  
- **Arrange**: Create an empty linked list (i.e., the `head` of the linked list is `nil`).  
- **Act**: Call `RemoveAtEnd()` on this empty list.  
- **Assert**: Verify that the returned value is `-1`.  
**Validation**:  
- The choice of using `-1` as the return value for an empty list is logical since it represents an invalid operation (removing from an empty list).  
- This test ensures that the function handles edge cases where the list is empty, preventing potential runtime errors or crashes.

---

### Scenario 2: Removing from a Single-Element Linked List

Details:  
**Description**: This test verifies the behavior of the `RemoveAtEnd` method when the linked list contains only one element. In this case, `RemoveAtEnd()` should behave like `RemoveAtBeg()` and remove the only element in the list.  
**Execution**:  
- **Arrange**: Create a linked list with one element (i.e., `head` is not `nil`, and `head.next` is `nil`).  
- **Act**: Call `RemoveAtEnd()` on this single-element list.  
- **Assert**: Verify that the returned value is the value of the element that was removed.  
**Validation**:  
- The function should delegate to `RemoveAtBeg()` when there is only one element in the list, and this test ensures it does so correctly.  
- This is an essential test to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the list becomes empty after removing the last element.

---

### Scenario 3: Removing from a Multi-Element Linked List

Details:  
**Description**: This test checks the normal operation of `RemoveAtEnd()` when the list contains multiple elements. The function should remove the last element and return its value.  
**Execution**:  
- **Arrange**: Create a linked list with multiple elements (i.e., `head` is not `nil`, and `head.next` is also not `nil`).  
- **Act**: Call `RemoveAtEnd()` on this multi-element list.  
- **Assert**: Verify that the returned value is the value of the last element and that the second-to-last element now points to `nil`.  
**Validation**:  
- This test ensures that the function correctly traverses the list to find and remove the last element.  
- Ensuring that the second-to-last element's `next` pointer is updated to `nil` is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the list structure.

---

### Scenario 4: Removing from a List with Two Elements

Details:  
**Description**: This test checks the behavior of `RemoveAtEnd()` when the linked list contains exactly two elements. After removing the last element, the list should contain only one element, and the `head` should still point to the first element.  
**Execution**:  
- **Arrange**: Create a linked list with two elements (i.e., `head` is not `nil`, and `head.next` is not `nil`, but `head.next.next` is `nil`).  
- **Act**: Call `RemoveAtEnd()` on this two-element list.  
- **Assert**: Verify that the returned value is the value of the second element and that the list now contains only the first element (i.e., `head.next` is `nil`).  
**Validation**:  
- This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the list has exactly two elements, and it properly removes the last one without affecting the first.  
- This scenario is important for verifying the correct behavior of the function when the list has a minimal number of elements.

---

### Scenario 5: Removing from a List with Negative Values

Details:  
**Description**: This test checks the behavior of `RemoveAtEnd()` when the linked list contains negative values. The function should still correctly remove the last element and return its value, regardless of whether the values are negative.  
**Execution**:  
- **Arrange**: Create a linked list where the values of the nodes are negative integers (e.g., `-1`, `-5`, `-9`).  
- **Act**: Call `RemoveAtEnd()` on this list.  
- **Assert**: Verify that the returned value is the value of the last element (e.g., `-9`) and that the second-to-last element now points to `nil`.  
**Validation**:  
- This test ensures that the function works correctly with negative numbers, which is important for ensuring that the implementation is not dependent on positive values.  
- Handling negative values correctly is crucial for applications that might deal with such data.

---

### Scenario 6: Removing from a List with Duplicate Values

Details:  
**Description**: This test checks the behavior of `RemoveAtEnd()` when the linked list contains duplicate values. The function should still correctly remove the last element, even if it has the same value as other elements in the list.  
**Execution**:  
- **Arrange**: Create a linked list where some of the nodes have the same value (e.g., `1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3`).  
- **Act**: Call `RemoveAtEnd()` on this list.  
- **Assert**: Verify that the returned value is the value of the last element (e.g., `3`) and that the second-to-last element now points to `nil`.  
**Validation**:  
- This test ensures that the function correctly removes the last element without being confused by duplicate values elsewhere in the list.  
- Handling duplicate values is critical for ensuring that the function focuses on position (i.e., the last element) rather than value uniqueness.

---

### Scenario 7: Removing from a List with Mixed Data Types (if applicable)

Details:  
**Description**: If the linked list is implemented in such a way that it can store different data types (e.g., integers, strings, etc.), this test checks the behavior of `RemoveAtEnd()` when the list contains mixed data types.  
**Execution**:  
- **Arrange**: Create a linked list where nodes contain mixed data types (e.g., `1 -> "two" -> 3.0`).  
- **Act**: Call `RemoveAtEnd()` on this list.  
- **Assert**: Verify that the returned value is the value of the last element (e.g., `3.0`) and that the second-to-last element now points to `nil`.  
**Validation**:  
- This test ensures that the function works correctly with different data types, which is important for applications that store heterogeneous data.  
- Handling mixed data types is crucial for ensuring flexibility in data storage and retrieval.

---

### Scenario 8: Removing from a List with Large Number of Elements

Details:  
**Description**: This test checks the behavior of `RemoveAtEnd()` when the linked list contains a large number of elements. The function should still correctly remove the last element, even if the list is very long.  
**Execution**:  
- **Arrange**: Create a linked list with a large number of elements (e.g., 1000 elements).  
- **Act**: Call `RemoveAtEnd()` on this list.  
- **Assert**: Verify that the returned value is the value of the last element and that the second-to-last element now points to `nil`.  
**Validation**:  
- This test ensures that the function can handle large lists efficiently without performance degradation or errors.  
- Handling large data sets is important for applications that deal with significant amounts of data.

---

### Scenario 9: Removing from a List with Non-Contiguous Memory (if applicable)

Details:  
**Description**: If the linked list is implemented using pointers (i.e., memory addresses), this test checks the behavior of `RemoveAtEnd()` when the list nodes are not stored in contiguous memory locations.  
**Execution**:  
- **Arrange**: Create a linked list where nodes are dynamically allocated in such a way that they are not stored in contiguous memory locations.  
- **Act**: Call `RemoveAtEnd()` on this list.  
- **Assert**: Verify that the returned value is the value of the last element and that the second-to-last element now points to `nil`.  
**Validation**:  
- This test ensures that the function works correctly regardless of how memory is allocated for the nodes.  
- Handling non-contiguous memory correctly is important for ensuring that the function works in any memory allocation scenario.

---

### Scenario 10: Removing from a List with Circular References (if applicable)

Details:  
**Description**: If the linked list can potentially have circular references (i.e., where a node's `next` pointer points back to a previous node), this test checks the behavior of `RemoveAtEnd()` to ensure it doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop.  
**Execution**:  
- **Arrange**: Create a linked list with a circular reference (e.g., the last node points back to an earlier node).  
- **Act**: Call `RemoveAtEnd()` on this list.  
- **Assert**: Verify that the function does not enter an infinite loop and that it either removes the last element or handles the circular reference appropriately.  
**Validation**:  
- This test ensures that the function correctly handles circular references, which is important for avoiding infinite loops and potential crashes in the application.  
- Handling circular references is a critical edge case for ensuring the robustness of the linked list implementation.
