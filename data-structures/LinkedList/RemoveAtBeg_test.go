Here are several test scenarios for the `RemoveAtBeg` function, covering normal operation, edge cases, and error handling, while following the format you specified:

---

### Scenario 1: Remove from an Empty LinkedList

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test checks the behavior of the `RemoveAtBeg` function when called on an empty linked list. The function should return `-1` when there are no elements to remove.
  
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Create an empty `LinkedList` instance (i.e., `ll.head == nil`).
  - **Act:** Call the `RemoveAtBeg` method on this empty linked list.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the return value is `-1`, indicating that the list is empty.

- **Validation:**
  - The assertion is based on the fact that an empty list cannot have any elements to remove. Returning `-1` is the expected behavior to signal that the operation is invalid in this case.
  - This test is important because it ensures that the function handles this edge case gracefully, preventing any runtime errors or panics.

---

### Scenario 2: Remove the Only Element in the LinkedList

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test checks the behavior when removing the only element in a linked list. After removal, the list should be empty, and the value of the removed element should be returned.
  
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Create a `LinkedList` with a single node (e.g., `ll.head.val == 10`).
  - **Act:** Call `RemoveAtBeg` on this linked list.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the return value is the value of the removed node (e.g., `10`). Also, confirm that `ll.head` is now `nil`, indicating that the list is empty.

- **Validation:**
  - This assertion ensures that the function correctly handles the case where there is only one element, removing it properly and setting the list to empty.
  - This test is critical because it ensures that the function correctly updates the linked list structure, preventing memory leaks or dangling pointers.

---

### Scenario 3: Remove from a LinkedList with Multiple Elements

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test checks the behavior when removing the first element from a linked list with multiple elements. The head pointer should be updated to point to the next node, and the previous pointer of the new head should be set to `nil`.
  
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Create a `LinkedList` with multiple nodes (e.g., `[10 -> 20 -> 30]`).
  - **Act:** Call `RemoveAtBeg` on this linked list.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the return value is the value of the first node (e.g., `10`). Additionally, confirm that the new head of the list is the second node (e.g., `ll.head.val == 20`), and its `prev` pointer is `nil`.

- **Validation:**
  - The assertion ensures that the head is updated correctly, and the return value corresponds to the removed element.
  - This test is important because it verifies that the function correctly handles the internal pointers when removing an element from the front of the list, ensuring the list remains properly linked.

---

### Scenario 4: Remove Multiple Times Until LinkedList is Empty

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test checks the behavior of the `RemoveAtBeg` function when called repeatedly on a linked list until it is empty. The function should return the values of the removed elements in the correct order, and eventually return `-1` when the list becomes empty.
  
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Create a `LinkedList` with multiple nodes (e.g., `[10 -> 20 -> 30]`).
  - **Act:** Call `RemoveAtBeg` multiple times in sequence until the list is empty.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the return values are `10`, `20`, `30` in sequence, and that a subsequent call returns `-1`.

- **Validation:**
  - The assertion ensures that the function correctly removes elements one by one and eventually signals the empty state.
  - This test is important because it confirms that the function behaves correctly across multiple invocations, ensuring consistent state management in the linked list.

---

### Scenario 5: Remove from a LinkedList with Two Elements

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test checks the behavior when removing the first element from a linked list with exactly two elements. After removal, the second element should become the new head, and its `prev` pointer should be `nil`.
  
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Create a `LinkedList` with two nodes (e.g., `[10 -> 20]`).
  - **Act:** Call `RemoveAtBeg` on this linked list.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the return value is `10`, and confirm that the new head is the second node (`ll.head.val == 20`) with its `prev` pointer set to `nil`.

- **Validation:**
  - The assertion ensures that the function correctly updates the pointers when there are exactly two elements in the list.
  - This test is critical because it verifies that the function correctly handles small lists and properly maintains the list structure after removal.

---

### Scenario 6: Remove from a Circular LinkedList (Edge Case)

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test checks the behavior when removing an element from a circular linked list. Although circular linked lists are not the intended use case, the function should still handle this gracefully without causing infinite loops or incorrect behavior.
  
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Create a circular `LinkedList` where the last node points back to the first node (i.e., `ll.head.next.next = ll.head`).
  - **Act:** Call `RemoveAtBeg` on this circular linked list.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the function returns the value of the first node and updates the head without causing any infinite loops or crashes.

- **Validation:**
  - The assertion ensures that the function handles circular lists without breaking, even though the function is not designed for circularity.
  - This test is important because it verifies that the function won't behave unpredictably in unexpected use cases, such as circular lists.

---

### Scenario 7: Concurrent Removes on LinkedList (Concurrency Edge Case)

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test checks the behavior of the `RemoveAtBeg` function when called concurrently. This scenario ensures that the function is thread-safe or identifies potential concurrency issues.
  
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Create a `LinkedList` with multiple elements (e.g., `[10 -> 20 -> 30]`).
  - **Act:** Call `RemoveAtBeg` concurrently from multiple goroutines.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the function handles concurrent access without data races or inconsistent results (e.g., no duplicate removals).

- **Validation:**
  - The assertion ensures that the function can handle concurrent access or highlights potential thread-safety issues.
  - This test is important because it ensures the robustness of the function in multi-threaded environments, especially if the linked list is shared across goroutines.

---

### Scenario 8: Remove from a LinkedList with Nodes Containing Negative Values

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test checks the behavior when removing nodes with negative values, ensuring that the function handles all types of integer values correctly.
  
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Create a `LinkedList` with nodes containing negative values (e.g., `[-10 -> -20 -> -30]`).
  - **Act:** Call `RemoveAtBeg` on this linked list.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the return value is `-10`, and the new head is the second node (`ll.head.val == -20`).

- **Validation:**
  - The assertion ensures that the function correctly handles negative values, as they are valid integers.
  - This test is important because it verifies that the function works for all integer values, not just positive ones.

---

These test scenarios comprehensively cover the function's behavior under various conditions, including normal operation, edge cases, and concurrency considerations.
