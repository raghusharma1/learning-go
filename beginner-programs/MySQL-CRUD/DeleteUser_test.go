================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The code uses string concatenation for SQL queries, potentially allowing malicious input to manipulate the query structure.
Solution: Use parameterized queries with db.Exec() to prevent SQL injection. The current implementation is correct in this aspect.

Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function uses log.Fatal() to handle errors, which abruptly terminates the program. This can lead to denial of service and prevent proper error handling or recovery.
Solution: Return the error to the caller instead of using log.Fatal(). This allows for more flexible error handling: 'return fmt.Errorf("failed to delete user: %w", err)'

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The code doesn't ensure that database connections are properly closed, which may lead to resource leaks.
Solution: Use db.Close() when the database connection is no longer needed, typically in a defer statement after opening the connection.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function doesn't validate the 'id' parameter, potentially allowing negative or zero values that might lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Add input validation for the 'id' parameter: 'if id <= 0 { return fmt.Errorf("invalid user id: %d", id) }'

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `deleteUser` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully delete an existing user

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteUser function can successfully remove a user from the database when given a valid user ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database connection and insert a test user with a known ID.
  Act: Call deleteUser with the test database connection and the known user ID.
  Assert: Verify that the user with the given ID no longer exists in the database.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if a query for the deleted user returns no results. This test is crucial to ensure the basic functionality of user deletion works as expected.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a non-existent user

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of deleteUser when trying to delete a user that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database connection and ensure no user exists with a specific ID.
  Act: Call deleteUser with the test database connection and the non-existent user ID.
  Assert: Verify that the function doesn't panic or throw an error, and that the database state remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function gracefully handles attempts to delete non-existent users without causing errors or unintended side effects.

Scenario 3: Handle database connection error

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the database connection is invalid or closed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that simulates a connection error.
  Act: Call deleteUser with the mock database and any user ID.
  Assert: Verify that the function logs a fatal error.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function properly handles database connection issues, preventing silent failures and providing appropriate error information.

Scenario 4: Verify SQL injection prevention

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteUser function is protected against SQL injection attempts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database connection with a known user.
  Act: Call deleteUser with the test database connection and a malicious input as the user ID (e.g., "1 OR 1=1").
  Assert: Verify that only the specific user is deleted and not all users.
Validation:
  This test is critical for security, ensuring that the function safely handles user input and prevents unauthorized data manipulation.

Scenario 5: Test concurrent deletion of users

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the deleteUser function can handle multiple concurrent deletion requests without race conditions or data inconsistencies.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database connection and insert multiple test users.
  Act: Concurrently call deleteUser for different user IDs using goroutines.
  Assert: Verify that all specified users are deleted correctly without affecting other users.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's thread-safety and ability to handle concurrent operations, which is important for applications with high concurrency.

Scenario 6: Verify database transaction integrity

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteUser function maintains database integrity by properly handling transactions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database connection with a user and related data in other tables.
  Act: Call deleteUser to delete the user.
  Assert: Verify that the user is deleted and any related data is handled according to the database's referential integrity rules.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that deleting a user doesn't leave orphaned data or violate database constraints, maintaining data consistency across tables.
```

These test scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `deleteUser` function. They address various aspects including basic functionality, error handling, security, concurrency, and data integrity.
