================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
Issue: Passwords are stored and retrieved in plaintext, potentially exposing user credentials if the database is compromised.
Solution: Use a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to hash passwords before storage. Only store and compare hashed passwords.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The SQL query is constructed without parameterization, potentially allowing SQL injection attacks if user input is involved.
Solution: Use parameterized queries with db.Query() or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Error details are logged using log.Fatal(), which may expose sensitive information in production environments.
Solution: Use custom error handling to log errors securely and return appropriate error responses without exposing internal details.

Vulnerability: CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
Issue: User passwords are retrieved and potentially exposed in memory or logs, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
Solution: Avoid retrieving full user credentials. If necessary, implement secure password comparison methods on the server side.

================================================================================
Here are several test scenarios for the `queryAllUser` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successful Query of Multiple Users

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can successfully query and return multiple users from the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with multiple user entries.
  Act: Call queryAllUser with the mock database.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct number of users and that each user's data matches the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures the core functionality of retrieving all users works correctly. It's crucial for verifying that the function can handle multiple rows and correctly populate the users slice.

Scenario 2: Empty User Table

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when the users table is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with an empty users table.
  Act: Call queryAllUser with the mock database.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice of users without errors.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function handles edge cases gracefully, specifically when there are no users in the database.

Scenario 3: Database Connection Error

Details:
  Description: Test the function's error handling when there's a database connection issue.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns a connection error.
  Act: Call queryAllUser with the faulty database connection.
  Assert: Verify that the function logs a fatal error.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring proper error handling when database connections fail, which is a common real-world scenario.

Scenario 4: Query Execution Error

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when the SQL query execution fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns an error when executing the SELECT query.
  Act: Call queryAllUser with this mock database.
  Assert: Verify that the function logs a fatal error.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly handles SQL query execution errors, which could occur due to various reasons like syntax errors or permission issues.

Scenario 5: Row Scanning Error

Details:
  Description: Test the function's error handling when scanning a row fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns data that can't be scanned into the user struct (e.g., mismatched types).
  Act: Call queryAllUser with this mock database.
  Assert: Verify that the function logs a fatal error during row scanning.
Validation:
  This test is important for catching potential issues with data type mismatches or corrupted data in the database.

Scenario 6: Large Dataset Handling

Details:
  Description: Test the function's performance and memory usage with a large number of users.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a large number of user entries (e.g., 100,000+).
  Act: Call queryAllUser with this large dataset.
  Assert: Verify that the function successfully retrieves all users without running out of memory or taking an unreasonable amount of time.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle large datasets efficiently, which is crucial for scalability in real-world applications.

Scenario 7: Null Values in Database

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when encountering null values in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with some null values in various fields (e.g., null username or created_at).
  Act: Call queryAllUser with this database.
  Assert: Verify that the function handles null values appropriately, either by setting default values or preserving the null state in the struct.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring robustness when dealing with incomplete or partially populated database records.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `queryAllUser` function. They test the function's ability to handle successful queries, empty results, various error conditions, large datasets, and null values, providing comprehensive coverage of potential scenarios the function might encounter in a real-world application.
