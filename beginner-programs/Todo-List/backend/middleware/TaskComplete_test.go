Scenario 1: Normal operation with valid task ID

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly marks a task as complete when provided with a valid task ID. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `taskComplete` function to simulate marking a task as complete. Create a mock HTTP request with a valid task ID in the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the `TaskComplete` function with the mock HTTP request and response writer.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the `taskComplete` function was called with the correct task ID, and that the response writer was encoded with the same task ID.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the function correctly passes the task ID from the HTTP request to the `taskComplete` function and the response writer. This is crucial for the function's ability to mark tasks as complete and inform the client of the operation's result.

Scenario 2: Operation with invalid task ID

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function handles an invalid task ID correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `taskComplete` function to simulate an error when marking a task as complete. Create a mock HTTP request with an invalid task ID in the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the `TaskComplete` function with the mock HTTP request and response writer.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the `taskComplete` function was called with the incorrect task ID, and that an appropriate error response was sent to the client.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the function correctly handles an invalid task ID by returning an appropriate error response. This is crucial for the function's robustness and its ability to inform the client of any errors.

Scenario 3: Operation with missing task ID

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function handles a missing task ID correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `taskComplete` function to simulate an error when marking a task as complete. Create a mock HTTP request without a task ID in the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the `TaskComplete` function with the mock HTTP request and response writer.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the `taskComplete` function was not called, and that an appropriate error response was sent to the client.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the function correctly handles a missing task ID by not calling the `taskComplete` function and returning an appropriate error response. This is crucial for the function's robustness and its ability to inform the client of any errors.
