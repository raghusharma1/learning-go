Scenario 1: Undo a valid task

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the UndoTask function is able to undo a task correctly when provided with a valid task id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a task id that exists in the database. Mock the http.ResponseWriter and http.Request with the task id.
  Act: Invoke the UndoTask function with the mock ResponseWriter and Request.
  Assert: Verify that the UndoTask function does not return an error.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the UndoTask function is able to handle valid inputs correctly. This test is important as it verifies the primary functionality of the UndoTask function, which is a crucial feature of the application.

Scenario 2: Undo a non-existent task

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the UndoTask function handles the scenario where it is asked to undo a task that does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a task id that does not exist in the database. Mock the http.ResponseWriter and http.Request with the task id.
  Act: Invoke the UndoTask function with the mock ResponseWriter and Request.
  Assert: Verify that the UndoTask function returns an error.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the UndoTask function is able to handle invalid inputs correctly and does not crash when asked to undo a task that does not exist. This test is important as it checks the robustness of the UndoTask function.

Scenario 3: Undo a task without providing a task id

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the UndoTask function handles the scenario where it is asked to undo a task but no task id is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a http.Request without a task id. Mock the http.ResponseWriter.
  Act: Invoke the UndoTask function with the mock ResponseWriter and Request.
  Assert: Verify that the UndoTask function returns an error.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the UndoTask function is able to handle scenarios where the required input is missing. This is important as it checks the function's ability to handle edge cases and provide informative error messages.

Scenario 4: Undo a task with an invalid task id format

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the UndoTask function handles the scenario where it is provided with a task id that does not match the expected format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a task id that does not match the expected format. Mock the http.ResponseWriter and http.Request with the task id.
  Act: Invoke the UndoTask function with the mock ResponseWriter and Request.
  Assert: Verify that the UndoTask function returns an error.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the UndoTask function is able to handle invalid inputs correctly and does not crash when provided with a task id that does not match the expected format. This test is important as it checks the robustness of the UndoTask function and its ability to handle edge cases.
