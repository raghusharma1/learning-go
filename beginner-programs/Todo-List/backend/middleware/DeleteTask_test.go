ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=DeleteTask_9ddf916cf4

Scenario 1: Normal Operation of the DeleteTask Function

Details:
  Description: This test will check if the DeleteTask function is able to successfully delete a task given a valid task id. The function should process the request, delete the task from the database, and return the id of the deleted task in the response.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock task id and a mock http request with the task id as a parameter. Mock the deleteOneTask function to simulate successful task deletion.
  Act: Invoke the DeleteTask function with the mock http request.
  Assert: Check if the http response writer contains the same task id that was passed in the request.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function is able to successfully delete a task and return the correct task id in the http response. This test is important to verify that the function is able to carry out its basic operation of deleting a task.

Scenario 2: Handling of Invalid Task Id

Details:
  Description: This test will check if the DeleteTask function is able to handle an invalid task id. The function should return an error message in the http response.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock http request with an invalid task id as a parameter. Mock the deleteOneTask function to simulate an error when trying to delete a task with an invalid id.
  Act: Invoke the DeleteTask function with the mock http request.
  Assert: Check if the http response writer contains an error message.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function is able to correctly handle an invalid task id and return an error message in the http response. This test is important to verify that the function can handle error cases and return appropriate error messages.

Scenario 3: Handling of Empty Task Id

Details:
  Description: This test will check if the DeleteTask function is able to handle an empty task id. The function should return an error message in the http response.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock http request with an empty task id as a parameter. Mock the deleteOneTask function to simulate an error when trying to delete a task with an empty id.
  Act: Invoke the DeleteTask function with the mock http request.
  Assert: Check if the http response writer contains an error message.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function is able to correctly handle an empty task id and return an error message in the http response. This test is important to verify that the function can handle edge cases and return appropriate error messages.
