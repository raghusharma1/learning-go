ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=GetAllTask_09b678baa9

Scenario 1: Normal operation: All tasks retrieval success

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function GetAllTask successfully retrieves all tasks. The target scenario is the normal operation where the function is expected to return the correct tasks without any errors.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock HTTP request and response writer. Populate the database with some dummy tasks.
    Act: Invoke the GetAllTask function with the mock request and response writer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes (i.e., the tasks returned by the function match the tasks in the database).
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function, which is to return all tasks in the database. The test is important in ensuring that the function is working as expected and is able to retrieve tasks without any issues.

Scenario 2: Edge case: No tasks in the database

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function GetAllTask can handle the situation where there are no tasks in the database. The target scenario is when the database is empty.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock HTTP request and response writer. Ensure that the database is empty.
    Act: Invoke the GetAllTask function with the mock request and response writer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an empty list.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when there are no tasks in the database. The test is important in ensuring that the function can handle edge cases and doesn't crash or return errors when the database is empty.

Scenario 3: Error handling: Database connection error

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function GetAllTask can handle errors when connecting to the database. The target scenario is when there is a problem with the database connection.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock HTTP request and response writer. Simulate a database connection error.
    Act: Invoke the GetAllTask function with the mock request and response writer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when there is a database connection error. The test is important in ensuring that the function can handle errors properly and doesn't crash when there are issues with the database connection.
