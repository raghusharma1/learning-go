Scenario 1: Normal operation and successful retrieval of all tasks

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the function getAllTask. The scenario covers the situation where the function is able to successfully retrieve all tasks from the database without any errors.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a mock database with a known set of tasks. Mock the collection.Find method to return a cursor that iterates over the known set of tasks without any errors.
Act: Invoke the getAllTask function.
Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the returned slice of tasks matches the known set of tasks in the mock database.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly retrieves all tasks from the database. This is important as it verifies the function's main purpose and ensures that it can successfully interact with the database.

Scenario 2: Handling of database errors during task retrieval

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the function's error handling when there are database errors during task retrieval. The scenario covers the situation where the function encounters an error while trying to find tasks in the database.

Execution:
Arrange: Mock the collection.Find method to return an error.
Act: Invoke the getAllTask function.
Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the function logs the returned error and does not return any tasks.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles database errors, logs them, and does not return any tasks in these situations. This is important as it verifies the function's error handling and ensures that it can gracefully handle failure scenarios.

Scenario 3: Handling of errors during task decoding

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the function's error handling when there are errors during task decoding. The scenario covers the situation where the function encounters an error while trying to decode a task from the cursor.

Execution:
Arrange: Mock the cursor's Decode method to return an error for a specific task.
Act: Invoke the getAllTask function.
Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the function logs the returned error and does not include the problematic task in the returned slice of tasks.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles decoding errors, logs them, and does not include the problematic task in the returned results. This is important as it verifies the function's error handling and ensures that it can gracefully handle failure scenarios.

Scenario 4: Handling of errors during cursor iteration

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the function's error handling when there are errors during cursor iteration. The scenario covers the situation where the function encounters an error while checking if the cursor has a next result.

Execution:
Arrange: Mock the cursor's Next method to return false and set an error on the cursor.
Act: Invoke the getAllTask function.
Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the function logs the returned error and does not return any tasks after the problematic cursor position.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles cursor iteration errors, logs them, and does not return any tasks after the problematic cursor position. This is important as it verifies the function's error handling and ensures that it can gracefully handle failure scenarios.
