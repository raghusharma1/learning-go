Scenario 1: Validating the setup of response headers

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setupResponse function correctly sets up all the required headers in the ResponseWriter. The scenario targets the normal operation of the function, where it receives an http.ResponseWriter and http.Request.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock http.ResponseWriter and http.Request.
  Act: Invoke the setupResponse function with the mock http.ResponseWriter and http.Request.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the headers in the http.ResponseWriter have been set up correctly as per the function definition.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check each header in the http.ResponseWriter and ensure it matches the expected value set by the function. The logic behind the expected result is that the function is supposed to set up the headers in a specific way and any deviation from that is considered a failure. This test is important to ensure that the server responds to the client with the correct headers, allowing for proper communication between the client and server.

Scenario 2: Checking for non-existence of additional headers

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to ensure that the setupResponse function does not add any headers other than those specified in the function definition. This scenario is important in maintaining the integrity of the server response.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock http.ResponseWriter and http.Request.
  Act: Invoke the setupResponse function with the mock http.ResponseWriter and http.Request.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that no additional headers have been added to the http.ResponseWriter.

Validation:
  The assertion checks for the exact number of headers that should be present in the http.ResponseWriter. If there are more headers than expected, the test fails. This test is crucial in ensuring that the server response does not contain unnecessary information, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities or miscommunication with the client.

Scenario 3: Error handling when http.ResponseWriter is nil

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the setupResponse function handles a scenario where the http.ResponseWriter is nil.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a nil http.ResponseWriter and a mock http.Request.
  Act: Invoke the setupResponse function with the nil http.ResponseWriter and mock http.Request.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function handles this scenario without causing a runtime error.

Validation:
  The assertion is checking whether a nil http.ResponseWriter causes a runtime error in the function. The expected result is that the function should handle this scenario gracefully, without causing a panic or runtime error. This test is important for ensuring the robustness of the function, as a nil http.ResponseWriter could potentially crash the application.
