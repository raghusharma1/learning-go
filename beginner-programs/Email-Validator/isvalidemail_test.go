ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly reject valid email addresses, as this would prevent legitimate users from signing up or logging in.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses. This is important to prevent users from signing up or logging in with invalid email addresses, which could lead to a host of issues, like failed email delivery.

Scenario 3: Test with an overly long email address

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address exceeding 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the overly long email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies overly long email addresses. This is crucial because overly long email addresses can lead to storage and processing inefficiencies, and they're typically not valid according to most email service providers' rules.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty string

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function handles an empty string, which is not a valid email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that is an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address. This is important because allowing empty strings as email addresses would be a clear violation of the function's intended behavior and the general expectations for email address validation.
