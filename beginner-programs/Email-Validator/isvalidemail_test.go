Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: C:\var\tmp\Roost\RoostGPT\gotest1\1732875450\source\learning-go\beginner-programs\Email-Validator\email_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Scenario 1: Email length is less than or equal to 255 characters and matches the email regular expression pattern

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function accurately validates a valid email. The email should not exceed 255 characters and should match the standard email pattern.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup data required.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with a valid email string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the result is true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly validates a valid email. This test is crucial to ensure that the function correctly identifies valid emails, which is a fundamental requirement for user registration and login.

Scenario 2: Email length exceeds 255 characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function accurately identifies an invalid email that exceeds the character limit.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup data required.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with an email string that exceeds 255 characters.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email based on length. This is important as the standard email length should not exceed 255 characters.

Scenario 3: Email does not match the regular expression pattern

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function accurately identifies an invalid email that does not match the regular expression pattern.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup data required.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with an email string that does not match the regular expression pattern.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email based on the regular expression pattern. This is important as the email format needs to follow a standard pattern.

Scenario 4: Email is an empty string

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function accurately identifies an invalid email when the string is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup data required.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with an empty string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email. This is important as an email should not be an empty string.
