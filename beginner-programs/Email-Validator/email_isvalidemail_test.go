File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/email_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Scenario 1: Valid Email Test

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the IsValidEmail function can correctly validate a standard, valid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: No specific setup is needed as we provide the valid email address directly.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with a valid email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true for a valid email.
Validation:
    This assertion is checking that our email validation is working properly for standard, valid email addresses. This is important as it verifies the core functionality of our email validation.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Test

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the IsValidEmail function can correctly identify an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: No specific setup is needed as we provide the invalid email address directly.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with an invalid email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false for an invalid email.
Validation:
    This assertion is checking that our email validation is working properly for invalid email addresses. This is important as it verifies that our validation can correctly identify and reject invalid email addresses.

Scenario 3: Empty String Test

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the IsValidEmail function can correctly handle an empty string as an input.
Execution:
    Arrange: No specific setup is needed as we provide the empty string directly.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with an empty string as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false for an empty string.
Validation:
    This assertion is checking that our email validation is correctly handling empty strings. This is important as it verifies that our validation can correctly identify and reject empty strings, which are not valid email addresses.

Scenario 4: Email Exceeding Length Limit Test

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the IsValidEmail function can correctly handle an email address that exceeds the length limit.
Execution:
    Arrange: Generate an email address that exceeds the maximum length limit.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false for an email address that exceeds the length limit.
Validation:
    This assertion is checking that our email validation is correctly handling email addresses that exceed the length limit. This is important as it verifies that our validation can correctly identify and reject overly long email addresses.
