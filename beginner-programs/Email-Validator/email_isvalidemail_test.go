Scenario 1: Valid Email Test

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly validates a properly formed email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with a valid email address string.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
    The function should return true for valid email strings. This test is important to ensure the function accurately recognizes a valid email address.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Test

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly invalidates an improperly formed email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with an invalid email address string.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The function should return false for invalid email strings. This test is important to ensure the function accurately recognizes an invalid email address.

Scenario 3: Email Length Exceeds Maximum Limit Test

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly invalidates an email address that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with an email address string that exceeds 255 characters.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The function should return false for email strings that exceed the maximum length. This test is important to ensure the function accurately recognizes when an email address is too long.

Scenario 4: Empty Email Test

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly invalidates an empty email string.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with an empty string.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The function should return false for empty email strings. This test is important to ensure the function accurately recognizes when an email address is empty.

Scenario 5: Email with Valid Length but Invalid Format Test

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly invalidates an email address that is within the valid length but has an invalid format.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with a valid length email address string but with an invalid format.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The function should return false for email strings that have an invalid format regardless of their length. This test is important to ensure the function accurately recognizes when an email address has an invalid format.
