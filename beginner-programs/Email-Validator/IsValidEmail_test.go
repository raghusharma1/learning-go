Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is true.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address. This test is important as it checks the primary functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address. This test is important as it checks if the function can prevent the entry of invalid email addresses.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an empty string.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly handles an empty string. This test is important as it checks if the function can prevent the entry of empty email addresses.

Scenario 4: Test with an email address that exceeds 255 characters

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address exceeding 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length. This test is important as it checks if the function can prevent the entry of excessively long email addresses.
