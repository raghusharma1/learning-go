ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    A valid email address should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify a valid email address, which is crucial for user registration, login, and communication.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An invalid email address should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important to ensure that the function can accurately identify invalid email addresses, preventing user registration with wrong email addresses and potential issues with communication.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An empty string should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function, as it does not represent a valid email address. This test is important to ensure that the function does not allow empty strings to pass as valid email addresses, preventing potential issues with user registration and communication.

Scenario 4: Test with a very long email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length as invalid.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address with more than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the very long email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An email address that exceeds the maximum length should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important to ensure that the function enforces the maximum length constraint for email addresses, preventing potential issues with data storage and processing.
