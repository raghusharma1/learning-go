ROOST_METHOD_HASH=IsValidEmail_9ebd397bff
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The function should return true when provided with a valid email address. This test is important because it verifies that the function is working as expected under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The function should return false when provided with an invalid email address. This test is important because it ensures that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses, preventing potential data corruption or misuse.

Scenario 3: Test with a string that exceeds the maximum length

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to check whether the function correctly handles strings that exceed the maximum length of an email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address exceeding 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the overly long email address.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The function should return false when provided with an email address that exceeds the maximum length. This test is important because it ensures that the function correctly handles edge cases, preventing potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty string

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The function should return false when provided with an empty string. This test is important because it ensures that the function correctly identifies empty strings as invalid email addresses, preventing potential data corruption or misuse.
