Scenario 1: Valid Email Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies a valid email. A valid email should have the format "username@domain.com" and should not exceed 255 characters.

Execution:
  Arrange: The test will use a string that follows the valid email format.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email string.
  Assert: The function should return true since the email is valid.

Validation:
  The function's purpose is to identify valid emails. This test is important as it confirms the function's ability to correctly identify valid emails. The assertion checks if the returned value is true, which is the expected outcome for a valid email.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an invalid email. An invalid email is one that doesn't follow the "username@domain.com" format or exceeds 255 characters.

Execution:
  Arrange: The test will use a string that doesn't follow the valid email format or exceeds 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email string.
  Assert: The function should return false since the email is invalid.

Validation:
  The function's purpose is to identify valid emails. This test is important as it confirms the function's ability to correctly identify invalid emails. The assertion checks if the returned value is false, which is the expected outcome for an invalid email.

Scenario 3: Empty Email Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function handles an empty string. An empty string is not a valid email address.

Execution:
  Arrange: The test will use an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: The function should return false since an empty string is not a valid email.

Validation:
  The function's purpose is to identify valid emails. This test is important as it checks the function's behavior when given an empty string. The assertion checks if the returned value is false, which is the expected outcome for an empty string.

Scenario 4: Email Length Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an email that exceeds 255 characters. An email that exceeds 255 characters is considered invalid.

Execution:
  Arrange: The test will use a string that exceeds 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email string.
  Assert: The function should return false since the email is too long.

Validation:
  The function's purpose is to identify valid emails. This test is important as it confirms the function's ability to correctly identify emails that are too long. The assertion checks if the returned value is false, which is the expected outcome for an email that exceeds 255 characters.
