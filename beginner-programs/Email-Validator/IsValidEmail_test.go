Scenario 1: Test with a valid email
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email.
    Assert: The function should return true.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly validates a properly formatted email. The function should return true, if it doesn't then there's a problem with the function's validation logic. This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly validate normal, properly formatted emails.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates a poorly formatted email.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email.
    Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly invalidates a poorly formatted email. The function should return false, if it doesn't then there's a problem with the function's validation logic. This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly invalidate poorly formatted emails.

Scenario 3: Test with a very long email
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an email that is too long.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an email that is more than 255 characters long.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email.
    Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly invalidates a too long email. The function should return false, if it doesn't then there's a problem with the function's validation logic. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly invalidates emails that are too long.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty email
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an empty email.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an empty email.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty email.
    Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly invalidates an empty email. The function should return false, if it doesn't then there's a problem with the function's validation logic. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly invalidates empty emails.
