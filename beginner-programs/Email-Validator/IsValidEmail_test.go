ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email.
  Assert: The function should return true.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly validates a properly formatted email. The importance of this test is to ensure that the function operates correctly under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an improperly formatted email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly invalidates a wrongly formatted email. The importance of this test is to ensure that the function operates correctly when provided with incorrect input.

Scenario 3: Test with an email longer than 255 characters
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an email that is too long.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an email address longer than 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly invalidates an email that is too long. The importance of this test is to ensure that the function operates correctly when provided with input that is too long.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty string
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles an empty string.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly invalidates an empty string. The importance of this test is to ensure that the function operates correctly when provided with an empty input.

Scenario 5: Test with a non-string input
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles a non-string input.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a variable with a non-string input.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the non-string input.
  Assert: The function should return an error.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly handles a non-string input. The importance of this test is to ensure that the function operates correctly when provided with a wrong type of input.
