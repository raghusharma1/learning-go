ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly reject valid email addresses.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly accept invalid email addresses.

Scenario 3: Test with an excessively long email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an email address that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an excessively long email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies excessively long email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly accept long email addresses, as they are not valid per the specifications.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an empty email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies empty email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly accept empty email addresses, as they are not valid.
