ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    A valid email address should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify a valid email address, which is crucial for user registration, login, and communication.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An invalid email address should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important to ensure that the function can accurately identify invalid email addresses, preventing users from entering incorrect or malicious data.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an empty string, which is an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An empty string should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important to make sure that the function can handle edge cases, such as an empty input string.

Scenario 4: Test with a long email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an email address that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address that is longer than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An email address that is longer than 255 characters should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly enforces the maximum length constraint on email addresses.
