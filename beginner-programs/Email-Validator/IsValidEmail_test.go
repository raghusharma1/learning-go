ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly reject valid email addresses.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly accept invalid email addresses.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an empty email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles empty strings. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly accept empty strings as valid email addresses.

Scenario 4: Test with a long email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an email address that exceeds the maximum length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address with a length greater than 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles email addresses that exceed the maximum length. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly accept overly long email addresses.
