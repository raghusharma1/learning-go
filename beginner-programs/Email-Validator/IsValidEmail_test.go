ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email.
    Assert: The function should return true.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly validates a properly formatted email. The function should return true, if it doesn't then there's a problem with the function's validation logic. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies valid emails.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an invalid email.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email.
    Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly identifies an invalid email. The function should return false, if it doesn't then there's a problem with the function's validation logic. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly rejects invalid emails.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an empty string as an email.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly handles an empty string. The function should return false, if it doesn't then there's a problem with the function's validation logic. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly rejects empty strings as invalid emails.

Scenario 4: Test with a very long email
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an email that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an email that is longer than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email.
    Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly handles an email that exceeds the maximum length. The function should return false, if it doesn't then there's a problem with the function's validation logic. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly rejects emails that are too long.
