Scenario 1: Valid Email Test

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the IsValidEmail function is able to correctly validate a properly formatted email.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We don't need any setup for this test.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with a valid email.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    We expect a valid email to return true. The assertion checks this expectation. This test is important because it verifies the function is working correctly for normal operation.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Test

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the IsValidEmail function is able to correctly identify an improperly formatted email.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We don't need any setup for this test.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with an invalid email.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    We expect an invalid email to return false. The assertion checks this expectation. This test is important because it verifies the function is working correctly for invalid inputs.

Scenario 3: Empty Email Test

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the IsValidEmail function is able to correctly handle an empty string input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We don't need any setup for this test.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with an empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    We expect an empty string to return false. The assertion checks this expectation. This test is important because it verifies the function is able to handle edge cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Email Exceeding Maximum Length Test

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the IsValidEmail function is able to correctly handle an email that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We don't need any setup for this test.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with an email that is more than 255 characters long.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    We expect an email exceeding the maximum length to return false. The assertion checks this expectation. This test is important because it verifies the function is able to handle edge cases correctly.
