ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Valid Email Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies a valid email address. A valid email address is one that is less than 255 characters and matches the regular expression defined in the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with a valid email address.
  Assert: The function should return true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses. This is important for ensuring the application only accepts valid email addresses for registration, login, and other operations.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an invalid email address. An invalid email address is one that does not match the regular expression defined in the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with an invalid email address.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses. This is important for preventing users from entering incorrect email addresses, which could lead to issues with account creation, password resets, etc.

Scenario 3: Email Exceeding Character Limit Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the character limit. An email address that is more than 255 characters is considered invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with an email address that is more than 255 characters.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies email addresses that exceed the character limit. This is important for maintaining data integrity and preventing potential issues with database storage or email delivery.

Scenario 4: Empty Email Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an empty email address. An empty email address is considered invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with an empty string.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies empty email addresses. This is important for preventing users from entering empty email addresses, which are not valid and could lead to issues with account creation, password resets, etc.
