ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    A valid email address should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify a valid email address, which is crucial for user registration, authentication, and communication.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An invalid email address should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important to ensure that the function can accurately identify invalid email addresses, preventing the registration of users with incorrect email formats.

Scenario 3: Test with an excessively long email address

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an email address that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address longer than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the excessively long email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An email address that exceeds the maximum length should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important for confirming that the function correctly handles email addresses that exceed the maximum length, thereby preventing the storage of unnecessarily long strings and potential memory overflow.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty email address

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the function handles an empty string as an email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An empty string should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important for ensuring that the function does not validate empty strings as valid email addresses, preventing the registration of users without valid email addresses.
