ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is true.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address. This test is important as it checks the primary functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: This test checks whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address. This test is important as it checks the function's ability to reject invalid input.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: This test checks whether the function correctly handles an empty string input, which is not a valid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that is an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly handles an empty string input. This test is important as it checks the function's robustness against edge cases.

Scenario 4: Test with a string that is over 255 characters

Details:
    Description: This test checks whether the function correctly handles a string input that is over 255 characters long, which is not a valid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that is over 255 characters long.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long string as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly handles a string input that is over 255 characters long. This test is important as it checks the function's robustness against edge cases.

'''
This test function "TestIsValidEmail" tests the function "IsValidEmail" with multiple test cases. Each test case is defined in a struct with name, email, and want fields. The "name" field is used to identify the test case, the "email" field is the input to the function, and the "want" field is the expected output. The test function uses the t.Run function to execute each test case and the t.Errorf function to report if the function does not produce the expected output.
