ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly flag valid emails as invalid, which would prevent legitimate users from signing up or logging in.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses. This is important to prevent users from signing up or logging in with invalid email addresses, which could lead to a host of issues, like failed email delivery.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that is empty.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address. This is important because an empty email field should not be considered valid, as it would prevent the application from contacting the user.

Scenario 4: Test with an email address that exceeds the length constraint

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address longer than 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the excessively long email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies overly long email addresses as invalid. This is important because the length constraint is a common requirement for email fields in databases and protocols, and exceeding it could lead to unexpected errors.
