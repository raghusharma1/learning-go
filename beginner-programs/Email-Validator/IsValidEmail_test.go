ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    A valid email address should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify a valid email address, which is a critical requirement in user registration and authentication processes.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An invalid email address should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important in ensuring that the function can accurately identify invalid email addresses, preventing the registration of users with incorrectly formatted emails.

Scenario 3: Test with an excessively long email address

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles email addresses that exceed the maximum length of 255 characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address exceeding 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the excessively long email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An email address that exceeds the maximum length should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important in ensuring that the function can correctly handle and reject excessively long email addresses, preventing potential buffer overflow attacks.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify how the function handles an empty string.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that is empty.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An empty string is not a valid email address and should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important in ensuring that the function can correctly identify and reject empty strings, preventing the registration of users without email addresses.
