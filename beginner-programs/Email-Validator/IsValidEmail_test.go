ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    A valid email address should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify a valid email address.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An invalid email address should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is crucial in ensuring that the function can accurately identify invalid email addresses.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles an empty string.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that is empty.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An empty string is not a valid email address, so the function should return false. This test is important for ensuring that the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Test with a very long email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles an email address that is longer than 255 characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address longer than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An email address longer than 255 characters is not valid, so the function should return false. This test is crucial for ensuring that the function correctly handles email addresses of excessive length.
