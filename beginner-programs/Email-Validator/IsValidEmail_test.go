Scenario 1: Test with a valid email
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email.
    Assert: The function should return true.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly validates a properly formatted email. The function is expected to return true when provided with a valid email. This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email.
    Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email. The function is expected to return false when provided with an invalid email. This test is important as it checks the function's ability to reject invalid inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an empty string.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly handles an empty string. The function is expected to return false when provided with an empty string. This test is important as it checks the function's ability to handle edge cases.

Scenario 4: Test with a string that is too long
Details: 
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles a string that is too long.
Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a string variable with a string that is longer than the maximum allowed length.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long string.
    Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
    The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly handles a string that is too long. The function is expected to return false when provided with a string that is longer than the maximum allowed length. This test is important as it checks the function's ability to enforce length restrictions.
