    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly invalidates an email address that exceeds the maximum length. This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly identify oversized emails.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an empty email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string as the parameter.
