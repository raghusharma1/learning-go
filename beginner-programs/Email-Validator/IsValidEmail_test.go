ROOST_METHOD_HASH=IsValidEmail_9ebd397bff
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly validates a well-formed email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required since we are providing a direct input.
  Act: Invoke the function with a valid email address.
  Assert: The function should return true.
Validation:
  We are using a well-formed email address which should pass the regex validation. The importance of this test is to ensure the function correctly validates a valid email address.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly invalidates a malformed email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required since we are providing a direct input.
  Act: Invoke the function with an invalid email address.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  We are using a malformed email address which should fail the regex validation. The importance of this test is to ensure the function correctly invalidates a malformed email address.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function behaves when provided with an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required since we are providing a direct input.
  Act: Invoke the function with an empty string.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  An empty string is not a valid email address and should therefore fail the validation. The importance of this test is to ensure the function correctly handles empty strings.

Scenario 4: Test with a string longer than 255 characters
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function behaves when provided with a string longer than 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required since we are providing a direct input.
  Act: Invoke the function with a string longer than 255 characters.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  According to the function's implementation, any string longer than 255 characters should fail the validation. The importance of this test is to ensure that the function correctly handles strings longer than 255 characters. 

Scenario 5: Test with a string exactly 255 characters long
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function behaves when provided with a string exactly 255 characters long.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required since we are providing a direct input.
  Act: Invoke the function with a string exactly 255 characters long.
  Assert: The function should return true if the string is a valid email, false otherwise.
Validation:
  According to the function's implementation, a string exactly 255 characters long should pass the length check. Whether it passes the regex check depends on the specific string. The importance of this test is to ensure the function correctly handles strings of maximum allowed length.
