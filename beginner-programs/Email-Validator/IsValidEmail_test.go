ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly flag valid emails as invalid, which would prevent legitimate users from signing up or logging in.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses. This is important to prevent users from signing up or logging in with invalid email addresses, which could lead to a host of issues, like failed email delivery.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address. This is important because an empty string is not a valid email address, and the function should reflect that.

Scenario 4: Test with an excessively long email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address exceeding 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the excessively long email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies excessively long email addresses as invalid. This is important because the maximum length of an email address is 255 characters, according to the specification, and the function should reflect that.

Scenario 5: Test with a maximum length email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates an email address that is exactly at the maximum length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address of exactly 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the maximum length email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies maximum length email addresses as valid. This is important because the maximum length of an email address is 255 characters, according to the specification, and the function should reflect that.
