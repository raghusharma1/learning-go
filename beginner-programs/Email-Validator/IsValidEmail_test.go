ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is true.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address. This test is important as it checks the primary functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address. This test is important as it checks if the function can prevent the entry of incorrectly formatted email addresses.

Scenario 3: Test with an excessively long email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an excessively long email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the excessively long email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies an excessively long email address. This test is important as it checks if the function can prevent the entry of excessively long email addresses, which are not allowed as per the email specifications.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an empty email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty email address as the parameter.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies an empty email address. This test is important as it checks if the function can prevent the entry of empty email addresses, which are not valid.
