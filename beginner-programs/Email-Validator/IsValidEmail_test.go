ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    A valid email address should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify a valid email address, which is crucial for user registration, login, and other operations.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An invalid email address should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important because it checks the function's ability to reject invalid email addresses, which is crucial for data validation and user input sanitation.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An empty string is not a valid email address and should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important because it checks the function's ability to handle empty input, which is a common edge case in user input.

Scenario 4: Test with a string longer than 255 characters

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to verify that the function returns false when the email address is longer than 255 characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address longer than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    According to the RFC 5321, the local part of an email address (the part before the @ symbol) must not exceed 64 characters, and the domain part (the part after the @ symbol) must not exceed 255 characters. This is why the function checks the length of the email address and returns false if it exceeds 255 characters. This test is important because it ensures that the function correctly handles email addresses that are too long.
