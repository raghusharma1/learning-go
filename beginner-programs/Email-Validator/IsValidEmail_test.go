ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly flag valid emails as invalid, which would prevent legitimate users from signing up or logging in.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses. This is important to prevent users from signing up or logging in with invalid email addresses, which could lead to a host of issues, like failed email delivery or inability to reset passwords.

Scenario 3: Test with an excessively long email address

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address with more than 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the excessively long email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies excessively long email addresses. This is important because email addresses that exceed 255 characters are not standard and could cause issues with email delivery or storage.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty string

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function handles an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address. This is important because an empty string is not a valid email address and allowing it could lead to issues with user identification or email delivery.

Scenario 5: Test with a null input

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function handles a null input.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no arrangement needed as the input will be null.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with a null input.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies a null input as an invalid email address. This is important because a null input is not a valid email address and allowing it could lead to runtime errors or issues with user identification or email delivery.
