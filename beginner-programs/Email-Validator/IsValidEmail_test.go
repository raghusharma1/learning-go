ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email.
  Assert: The function should return true.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly validates a properly formatted email. The test is important because it checks the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates a poorly formatted email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The assertion is meant to verify that the function correctly invalidates a poorly formatted email. This test is important because it checks the function's ability to reject invalid inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with an email that exceeds 255 characters
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an email that exceeds the maximum allowed length.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an email address that exceeds 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The assertion is meant to verify that the function correctly invalidates an email that exceeds the maximum allowed length. This test is important because it checks the function's ability to enforce length constraints.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an empty email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The assertion is meant to verify that the function correctly invalidates an empty email. This test is important because it checks the function's ability to reject empty inputs.

Scenario 5: Test with a null email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles a null email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with a null value.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the null value.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The assertion is meant to verify that the function correctly handles a null email. This test is important because it checks the function's ability to handle null inputs.
