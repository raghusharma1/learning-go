ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    A valid email address should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify a valid email address, which is crucial for user registration, login, and other operations.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An invalid email address should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important because it checks the function's ability to reject invalid email addresses, which is crucial for data validation and user input sanitation.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An empty string is not a valid email address and should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important because it checks the function's ability to handle empty input, which is a common edge case in user input.

Scenario 4: Test with a very long email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length as invalid.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address longer than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An email address that exceeds the maximum length should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important because it checks the function's ability to enforce length limitations, which is a common requirement in data validation.
