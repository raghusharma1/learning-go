ROOST_METHOD_HASH=IsValidEmail_9ebd397bff
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly flag valid emails as invalid, which would prevent legitimate users from signing up or logging in.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses. This is important to prevent users from signing up or logging in with invalid email addresses, which could lead to a host of issues, like failed email delivery.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that is empty.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address. This is important because an empty email field should not be considered valid, as it would not be possible to send emails to such an address.

Scenario 4: Test with an email address that exceeds the maximum length

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum allowed length of 255 characters as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address longer than 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the overly long email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies excessively long email addresses as invalid. This is important as it ensures that the function adheres to the email length standard, preventing database and email delivery issues.
