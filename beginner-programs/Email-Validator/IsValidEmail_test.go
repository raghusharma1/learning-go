ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    A valid email address should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify a valid email address, which is a fundamental requirement for any email validation functionality.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An invalid email address should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important to confirm that the function can accurately identify an invalid email address, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors during email processing.

Scenario 3: Test with an email address that exceeds the maximum length

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address with more than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An email address that exceeds the maximum length should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important to confirm that the function enforces the length constraint, which is necessary to prevent storage and processing issues associated with excessively long strings.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles an empty string, which is technically an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An empty string should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function, as it is not a valid email address. This test is important to confirm that the function appropriately handles empty strings, which are common edge cases that can cause errors if not properly addressed.
