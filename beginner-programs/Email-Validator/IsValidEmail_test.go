ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email.
  Assert: The function should return true.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly validates a properly formatted email. The logic behind the expected result is that the email is correctly formatted and is not longer than 255 characters. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies valid emails.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an invalid email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly identifies an invalid email. The logic behind the expected result is that the email is incorrectly formatted. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid emails.

Scenario 3: Test with a valid, but overly long email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies a valid but overly long email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with a valid but overly long email address (greater than 255 characters).
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the overly long email.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly identifies a valid but overly long email. The logic behind the expected result is that the email is correctly formatted but is longer than 255 characters. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies overly long emails.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty string
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an empty string.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly identifies an empty string. The logic behind the expected result is that an empty string is not a valid email. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies empty strings.

Scenario 5: Test with a string that is not an email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies a string that is not an email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with a string that is not an email.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the non-email string.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly identifies a string that is not an email. The logic behind the expected result is that a string that is not an email is not a valid email. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies strings that are not emails.
