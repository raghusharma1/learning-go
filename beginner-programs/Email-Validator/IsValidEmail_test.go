ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    A valid email address should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify a valid email address, which is crucial for user registration, login, and communication.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An invalid email address should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important to ensure that the function can accurately identify invalid email addresses, preventing user registration with wrong email addresses.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An empty string should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important for ensuring that the function can handle edge cases, like an empty string, as an email address should not be empty.

Scenario 4: Test with an excessively long email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an excessively long email address as invalid.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address that is longer than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An email address that is longer than 255 characters should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important for ensuring that the function correctly enforces the length limit on email addresses.

Scenario 5: Test with a maximum length email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates an email address that is exactly 255 characters long.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address that is exactly 255 characters long.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the maximum length email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    An email address that is exactly 255 characters long should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is important for ensuring that the function correctly handles email addresses that are at the maximum allowed length.
