ROOST_METHOD_HASH=IsValidEmail_9ebd397bff
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email.
  Assert: The function should return true.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly validates a properly formatted email. The test is important because it checks the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles an improperly formatted email.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly invalidates an improperly formatted email. This test is important because it checks if the function can reject invalid inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles an empty string.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an empty value.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is based on the fact that an empty string is not a valid email. This test is important because it checks if the function can handle edge cases.

Scenario 4: Test with a long email
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles an email address that is longer than 255 characters.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an email address that is longer than 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is based on the fact that an email address should not be longer than 255 characters. This test is important because it checks if the function can handle edge cases.

Scenario 5: Test with a non-string input
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles a non-string input.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Create a variable with a non-string value.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the non-string value.
  Assert: The function should return an error.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is based on the fact that the function should only accept string inputs. This test is important because it checks if the function can handle invalid types of inputs.
