ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly reject valid email addresses.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly invalidates an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly accept invalid email addresses.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an empty email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles empty strings. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly accept empty strings as valid email addresses.

Scenario 4: Test with a long email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an email address that exceeds the maximum length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address with more than 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles email addresses that exceed the maximum length. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly accept excessively long email addresses.

Scenario 5: Test with a maximum length email address

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly handles an email address that is exactly the maximum length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address with exactly 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the maximum length email address.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true if the email format is correct.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles email addresses that are exactly the maximum length. It's important to ensure that the function doesn't wrongly reject email addresses that are exactly the maximum length but are otherwise valid.
