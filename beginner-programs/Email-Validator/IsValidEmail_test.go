ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    The function should return true for a valid email address. The test is important because it verifies that the function correctly handles the most common case: a valid email address.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The function should return false for an invalid email address. The test is important because it verifies that the function correctly handles email addresses that do not meet the required format.

Scenario 3: Test with an email address that is too long

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an email address of more than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The function should return false for an email address that is too long. The test is important because it verifies that the function correctly handles email addresses that exceed the maximum length.

Scenario 4: Test with an empty email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an empty email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The function should return false for an empty email address. The test is important because it verifies that the function correctly handles an edge case: an empty string.
