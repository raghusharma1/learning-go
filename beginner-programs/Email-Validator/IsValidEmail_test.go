ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Valid Email Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies a valid email. The target scenario is where the input string is a correctly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we are directly providing the input string.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with a valid email address string.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies a valid email. This is important as the function needs to be able to correctly validate emails as per business requirements.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an invalid email. The target scenario is where the input string is not a correctly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we are directly providing the input string.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with an invalid email address string.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an invalid email. This is important as the function needs to be able to correctly validate emails as per business requirements.

Scenario 3: Email Length Exceeds 255 Characters Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an email that exceeds the maximum length of 255 characters. The target scenario is where the input string is a correctly formatted email address but its length exceeds 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we are directly providing the input string.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with a valid email address string that exceeds 255 characters in length.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an email that exceeds the maximum length. This is important as the function needs to be able to correctly validate emails as per business requirements.

Scenario 4: Empty Email Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an empty email. The target scenario is where the input string is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we are directly providing the input string.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with an empty string.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an empty email. This is important as the function needs to be able to correctly validate emails as per business requirements.
