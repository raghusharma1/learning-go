ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

Scenario 1: Test with a valid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly validates a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds a valid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    A valid email address should return true when passed to the IsValidEmail function. The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify a valid email address.

Scenario 2: Test with an invalid email address

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly identifies an invalid email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that holds an invalid email address.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An invalid email address should return false when passed to the IsValidEmail function. This test is crucial in ensuring that the function can accurately identify invalid email addresses.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty string

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles an empty string.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that is empty.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An empty string is not a valid email address, so the function should return false. This test is important for ensuring that the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Test with a string that is longer than 255 characters

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles a string that is longer than the maximum allowed length for an email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that is longer than 255 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    An email address that is longer than 255 characters is not valid, so the function should return false. This test is important for ensuring that the function correctly enforces the maximum length of an email address.

Scenario 5: Test with a string that is exactly 255 characters

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check how the function handles a string that is exactly the maximum allowed length for an email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable that is exactly 255 characters long.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the string.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns a boolean value.
Validation:
    An email address that is exactly 255 characters long is either valid or not, depending on its format. The function should return a boolean value, not an error. This test is important for ensuring that the function correctly handles edge cases.
