ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=pyramid_44386ccde4

Scenario 1: Regular Pyramid

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function prints a correct pyramid when a regular number is provided as input, such as 3.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to be 3.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected pyramid.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the pyramid function correctly prints a pyramid with 3 rows. This test is important as it checks the function's behavior with regular input.

Scenario 2: Pyramid with One Row

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function prints a correct pyramid when the input is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to be 1.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected pyramid with one row.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the pyramid function correctly prints a pyramid with one row. This test is important as it checks the function's behavior with edge case input.

Scenario 3: Pyramid with No Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function behaves correctly when the input is 0, which means no rows should be printed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to be 0.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function.
  Assert: Check if the output is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the pyramid function correctly handles the edge case where no rows should be printed. This test is important as it checks the function's error handling capabilities.

Scenario 4: Pyramid with Negative Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function behaves correctly when the input is a negative number, which is an invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to be -3.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function.
  Assert: Check if the output is empty or an error message is displayed.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the pyramid function correctly handles the edge case where the input is a negative number. This test is important as it checks the function's error handling capabilities.

Scenario 5: Pyramid with Non-integer Input

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function behaves correctly when the input is a non-integer, which is an invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to be "abc".
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function.
  Assert: Check if the function throws an error or handles the invalid input gracefully.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the pyramid function correctly handles the edge case where the input is a non-integer. This test is important as it checks the function's error handling capabilities.
