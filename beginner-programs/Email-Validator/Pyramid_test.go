ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=pyramid_44386ccde4

Scenario 1: Regular Pyramid

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function prints a correct pyramid when a regular number is provided as input, such as 3.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to be 3.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected pyramid.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the pyramid function correctly prints a pyramid with 3 rows. This test is important as it checks the function's behavior with regular input.

Scenario 2: Pyramid with One Row

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function prints a correct pyramid when the input is 1. This is an edge case where the pyramid will only have one row.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to be 1.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected pyramid.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the pyramid function correctly prints a pyramid with only one row. This test is important as it checks the function's behavior with edge case inputs.

Scenario 3: Pyramid with Zero Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the pyramid function's behavior when the input is 0. This is an edge case where the pyramid will have no rows.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to be 0.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function.
  Assert: Check if the output is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the pyramid function correctly handles a case where no pyramid should be printed. This test is important as it checks the function's behavior with edge case inputs.

Scenario 4: Negative Number Input

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the pyramid function's behavior when the input is a negative number. This is an error case where the user provides invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to be -3.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the error correctly, perhaps by not printing anything or by printing an error message.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the pyramid function correctly handles error scenarios. This test is vital as it checks the function's error handling capabilities. 

Scenario 5: Non-integer Input

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the pyramid function's behavior when the input is a non-integer. This is an error case where the user provides invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to be a non-integer such as 'abc'.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the error correctly, perhaps by not printing anything or by printing an error message.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the pyramid function correctly handles error scenarios. This test is vital as it checks the function's error handling capabilities.
