ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=pyramid_44386ccde4

Scenario 1: Regular Pyramid

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function is able to create a regular pyramid with the correct number of rows.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer value to represent the number of rows for the pyramid.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with the prepared integer value.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output matches the expected pyramid shape.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the output matches the expected pyramid shape, which is the expected behavior of the function. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle normal operation.

Scenario 2: Pyramid with Zero Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function can handle the edge case of zero rows.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer value of zero to represent the number of rows for the pyramid.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with the prepared integer value.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the output is an empty string, which is the expected behavior of the function when the number of rows is zero. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Pyramid with Negative Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function can handle the edge case of negative rows.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer value of negative to represent the number of rows for the pyramid.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with the prepared integer value.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output is an error message.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the output is an error message, which is the expected behavior of the function when the number of rows is negative. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle error cases.

Scenario 4: Pyramid with Large Number of Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function can handle a large number of rows.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large integer value to represent the number of rows for the pyramid.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with the prepared integer value.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output matches the expected pyramid shape.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the output matches the expected pyramid shape, which is the expected behavior of the function. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle large inputs.
