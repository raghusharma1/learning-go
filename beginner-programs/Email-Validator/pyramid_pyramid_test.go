FUNCTION_DEF=func pyramid() 
Scenario 1: Valid User Input for Pyramid Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the pyramid function when the user input for the number of rows is a valid positive integer. The target scenario is a normal operation where the user input is within the expected range.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user input for the number of rows as a valid positive integer.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with the mocked user input.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual output matches the expected pyramid pattern.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected output of the pyramid function given a specific number of rows. The logic behind the expected result is that the pyramid function should output a pyramid pattern with the same number of rows as the user input. This test is important because it validates the basic functionality of the pyramid function under normal operation.

Scenario 2: Invalid User Input for Pyramid Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the pyramid function when the user input for the number of rows is an invalid value (e.g., negative integer, zero, or non-integer). The target scenario is error handling where the user input is outside the expected range.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user input for the number of rows as an invalid value.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with the mocked user input.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the pyramid function handles the invalid input correctly (e.g., by returning an error, not producing any output, or producing a specific output indicating the input error).

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the pyramid function given an invalid number of rows. The logic behind the expected result is that the pyramid function should handle invalid user input in a way that prevents it from producing incorrect output or causing a runtime error. This test is important because it validates the error handling capabilities of the pyramid function.

Scenario 3: Extreme User Input for Pyramid Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the pyramid function when the user input for the number of rows is at the extreme end of the valid range (e.g., a very large integer). The target scenario is edge case testing where the user input is within the expected range but at an extreme value.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user input for the number of rows as an extreme value within the valid range.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with the mocked user input.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the pyramid function can handle the extreme input without causing a runtime error or producing incorrect output.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the pyramid function given an extreme number of rows. The logic behind the expected result is that the pyramid function should be able to handle extreme user input without causing a runtime error or producing incorrect output. This test is important because it validates the robustness of the pyramid function under extreme conditions.
