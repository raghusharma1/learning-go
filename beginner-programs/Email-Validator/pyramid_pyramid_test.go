Scenario 1: Valid Pyramid Generation

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the pyramid function generates the correct pyramid structure with a given valid number of rows.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or mocks are needed as the function doesn't require any parameters and doesn't have any dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with a valid number of rows.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the printed output matches the expected pyramid structure.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected printed output of the pyramid function. The expected result is a pyramid structure that corresponds to the number of rows given. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected under normal operation.

Scenario 2: Pyramid with Zero Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the pyramid function handles an input of zero rows.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or mocks are needed as the function doesn't require any parameters and doesn't have any dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with zero rows.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that no output is printed.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the pyramid function when given zero rows. The expected result is no printed output. This test is important for ensuring that the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Pyramid with Negative Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the pyramid function handles an input of negative rows.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or mocks are needed as the function doesn't require any parameters and doesn't have any dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with negative rows.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that no output is printed.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the pyramid function when given negative rows. The expected result is no printed output. This test is important for ensuring that the function handles error scenarios correctly.

NOTE: 
The pyramid function as currently implemented doesn't return any values and takes its input from the user at runtime, which makes it difficult to test in a conventional way. To make it testable, it could be refactored to take the number of rows as a parameter and return the pyramid as a string.
