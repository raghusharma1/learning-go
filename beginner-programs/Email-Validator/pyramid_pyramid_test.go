FUNCTION_DEF=func pyramid() 
Scenario 1: Normal Operation Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the pyramid function. The function is expected to take an input for the number of rows and print out a pyramid of asterisks with the number of rows specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: In this case, there's no need to set up any data, mocks, or test doubles.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function in the main function.
  Assert: As the function doesn't return anything and only prints to the console, assertions would involve checking the printed output. This can be done by redirecting the standard output to a buffer and checking the buffer's content.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's behavior â€“ it prints to the console instead of returning a value. The expected result is a string representation of a pyramid with the specified number of rows. This test is important to ensure that the pyramid function operates as expected under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Edge Case Test - Zero Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the pyramid function's behavior when the number of rows is zero. The function is expected to not print anything in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to arrange any data, mocks, or test doubles.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with 0 as the input for the number of rows.
  Assert: Check that nothing is printed to the console, by redirecting the standard output to a buffer and checking that the buffer's content is empty.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's behavior when given an input of 0 for the number of rows. The expected result is an empty string. This test is important to ensure that the pyramid function handles this edge case correctly.

Scenario 3: Error Handling Test - Negative Number of Rows

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the pyramid function's behavior when the number of rows is a negative number. The function is expected to handle this error gracefully, possibly by not printing anything.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to arrange any data, mocks, or test doubles.
  Act: Invoke the pyramid function with a negative number as the input for the number of rows.
  Assert: Check that nothing is printed to the console, by redirecting the standard output to a buffer and checking that the buffer's content is empty.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's behavior when given a negative input for the number of rows. The expected result is an empty string. This test is important to ensure that the pyramid function handles this error scenario correctly.
