================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The uploadHandler function processes file uploads without any CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to cause state-altering requests to be performed unintentionally.
Solution: Implement CSRF prevention mechanisms, such as using the gorilla/csrf package to insert and verify tokens in POST forms.

Vulnerability: CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: The code does not enforce file type validation, allowing potentially malicious files to be uploaded that could be executed on the server.
Solution: Validate the file type from the MIME type header, ensure it is among the allowed types, and store it outside the web root ideally with a hash-based name.

Vulnerability: CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
Issue: The display function and templates are invoked without context sanitization, which may lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) if user input is included in pages without proper escaping.
Solution: Ensure all dynamic content in templates is properly escaped or use golang.org/x/net/html to escape output bound for HTML responses.

================================================================================
Here are several test scenarios for the `uploadHandler` function:

### Scenario 1: Handling a GET Request for the Upload Page

#### Details:
- **Description:** This test checks whether a GET request to the upload handler correctly displays the upload page to the user.
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Set up a mock HTTP request with the method set to GET and a mock HTTP response writer.
  - **Act:** Call the `uploadHandler` function with the mock request and response writer.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the `display` function is called with the correct parameters, ensuring that the correct template is rendered.
- **Validation:**
  - **Explanation:** The assertion checks that the correct page is shown on a GET request, which is essential for user navigation.
  - **Importance:** Correctly handling GET requests ensures that users can access the upload interface, aligning with usability requirements.

### Scenario 2: Handling a POST Request for File Upload

#### Details:
- **Description:** This test confirms that a POST request triggers the file upload process, passing the request to the `uploadFile` function.
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Create a mock HTTP request with method POST, and a mock HTTP response writer. Optionally, include a mock file upload in the request body.
  - **Act:** Execute the `uploadHandler` function with these mocks.
  - **Assert:** Check that `uploadFile` is invoked with the correct arguments, which means the function is handling POST requests properly.
- **Validation:**
  - **Explanation:** The assertion ensures that POST requests are processed for file uploads.
  - **Importance:** This test is crucial as uploading files is a core functionality of the application, impacting user experience and application success.

### Scenario 3: Incorrect Method Handling

#### Details:
- **Description:** This scenario evaluates how the function handles HTTP methods other than GET or POST, ensuring that it does not crash or misbehave.
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Configure a mock HTTP request with an unsupported method (e.g., DELETE).
  - **Act:** Pass the mock request to the `uploadHandler`.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the response writer does not write any output or that a 405 Method Not Allowed response status is set.
- **Validation:**
  - **Explanation:** This assertion helps check robust method handling, avoiding unnecessary processing.
  - **Importance:** Preventing unexpected methods from executing logic helps keep the application secure and reliable.

### Scenario 4: Successful File Upload via POST Request

#### Details:
- **Description:** This scenario explores the process when a valid file is uploaded, leading to a successful upload completion.
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Prepare a mock valid POST request containing a file, alongside a mock response writer.
  - **Act:** Invoke `uploadHandler` using these setups.
  - **Assert:** Confirm that the function uploads the file successfully, possibly checking the success message or state in a follow-up.
- **Validation:**
  - **Explanation:** This checks end-to-end functionality, ensuring correct flow from request to upload completion.
  - **Importance:** Critical for application competence, directly impacting user satisfaction and application utility.

### Scenario 5: Large File Upload Handling

#### Details:
- **Description:** This test assesses the function's ability to handle and manage large file uploads, ensuring stability and responsiveness.
- **Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Construct a mock POST request with a large file, set up within system limits.
  - **Act:** Execute the handler function with this large payload.
  - **Assert:** Verify either successful completion or graceful failure handling, ensuring system stability.
- **Validation:**
  - **Explanation:** Assertion ensures that large data does not degrade performance or cause crashes.
  - **Importance:** Important for ensuring reliability and robustness, particularly in environments that handle large data uploads.

These scenarios broadly address typical cases, edge conditions, and ensure that the function behaves correctly under normal and abnormal conditions. They serve as a foundation for thorough unit testing of the `uploadHandler` function.
