ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=uploadFile_abff69295f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-434
Issue: The code saves uploaded files directly using their original filenames, which can lead to path traversal attacks and overwriting of sensitive files.
Solution: Sanitize the uploaded file names and save them in a predetermined directory with a controlled naming scheme to prevent overwriting and path traversal.

Vulnerability: CWE-502
Issue: The uncontrolled file uploads without validation or restrictions can lead to the upload of malicious files, including scripts or executables.
Solution: Implement file type validation by checking the MIME type or file extensions against an allowlist before accepting an upload.

Vulnerability: CWE-703
Issue: Lack of robust error handling for failed file operations may cause critical issues to go unnoticed and affect the program's reliability.
Solution: Implement detailed error handling and logging after file operations to offer insight into issues during file handling processes.

Vulnerability: CWE-73
Issue: Use of 'os.Create()' directly with user-provided filenames can lead to unintended file manipulations.
Solution: Use a secure function to generate unique, user-transparent filenames before saving, ensuring no conflict or manipulation by users.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Successful File Upload

**Details:**

- **Description:** This test checks the successful upload of a valid file by simulating an HTTP request containing a file. The test ensures correct file handling, i.e., receipt, saving to disk, and response confirmation.

**Execution:**

- **Arrange:** 
  - Prepare a multipart form HTTP request containing a valid file with a known file size and content.
  - Ensure a clean-up step to remove the file after the test.

- **Act:** 
  - Call the `uploadFile` function with the crafted HTTP request.

- **Assert:**
  - Verify the HTTP response is "Successfully Uploaded File".
  - Confirm the file is saved on disk with expected content and size.

**Validation:**

- The assertion checks that the correct message is returned and the file is correctly written to disk, which is crucial for confirming the core functionality of the file upload process.

---

### Scenario 2: Missing File in Request

**Details:**

- **Description:** This scenario tests how the `uploadFile` function handles a request that lacks the expected file, which should trigger error handling paths.

**Execution:**

- **Arrange:**
  - Create an HTTP request without the "myFile" part in the multipart form data.

- **Act:**
  - Call the `uploadFile` function with this request.

- **Assert:**
  - Verify the presence of error messages in the console output.
  - Check that no file is created.
  - Ensure the response does not indicate success.

**Validation:**

- Correct error handling is verified, validating robustness against erroneous HTTP requests, which is crucial in preventing unhandled exceptions or undefined behavior.

---

### Scenario 3: Large File Upload Exceeding Limit

**Details:**

- **Description:** This test checks the function's response to an oversized file, ensuring it respects the maximum allowed upload size and handles errors gracefully.

**Execution:**

- **Arrange:**
  - Create an HTTP request with a file that exceeds the 10MB limit defined in `ParseMultipartForm`.

- **Act:**
  - Invoke the `uploadFile` function with this oversized file request.

- **Assert:**
  - Confirm that the function does not indicate successful upload.
  - Verify no partially processed file appears on disk.

**Validation:**

- The test checks adherence to defined constraints, which is vital to application resource control and user experience by preventing excessive resource usage.

---

### Scenario 4: Disk Write Failure

**Details:**

- **Description:** Simulate a scenario where the server cannot write the file to disk, testing the error handling mechanism when file creation fails.

**Execution:**

- **Arrange:**
  - Use mocking to simulate a condition where the `os.Create` fails (such as lack of permission or full disk).

- **Act:**
  - Call `uploadFile` with a valid request, expecting the file creation to fail.

- **Assert:**
  - Check that an appropriate HTTP error status is returned in response.
  - Validate that no new file is found on disk.

**Validation:**

- This test ascertains reliability in resource handling failures, critical for maintaining application stability and avoiding data corruption.

---

### Scenario 5: Valid File but Fail to Copy to Disk

**Details:**

- **Description:** This scenario handles the case where copying the file content to disk fails (e.g., during an IO error).

**Execution:**

- **Arrange:**
  - Prepare a valid HTTP request.
  - Mock `io.Copy` to emulate a failure, triggering error handling paths.

- **Act:**
  - Invoke the `uploadFile` function with the crafted request.

- **Assert:**
  - Ensure the function returns an appropriate error status to the client.
  - Verify that the file is not retained on disk.

**Validation:**

- Validating handling of IO failures ensures that the application doesnâ€™t leave corrupted files in case of unexpected disruptions, essential for data integrity.

---

Each scenario targets crucial aspects of file upload handling, validating normal, exceptional, and boundary behaviors required to ensure robust application performance.
