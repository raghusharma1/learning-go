================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Path Traversal
Issue: The code uses `os.Create(handler.Filename)` directly with unvalidated file names from user input, leading to a path traversal vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to overwrite or create arbitrary files on the server.
Solution: Sanitize and validate the file names to prevent directory traversal. Use a safe directory to store the files and ensure the file name doesn't contain any path separators.

Vulnerability: CWE-434: Unrestricted File Upload
Issue: The code does not restrict the type or size of the uploaded file. This might allow a malicious user to upload executable or oversized files, risking server exploitation or DoS attacks.
Solution: Implement file type and size checks. Validate the file type using MIME type checks and restrict the size of uploads. Preferably implement checks at both application and server level for redundancy.

================================================================================
Here are several test scenarios designed to evaluate the `uploadFile` function from the "main" package. These scenarios aim to cover standard operation, error handling, and edge cases.

### Scenario 1: Successfully Upload a Valid File

Details:
  Description: This test checks if a valid file is successfully uploaded and saved to the server without any errors.

Execution:
  - **Arrange**: Create a mock HTTP request with a valid multipart file form, simulating the upload of a file named "testfile.txt". Prepare a mock HTTP response writer.
  - **Act**: Call the `uploadFile` function with the mocked request and response writer.
  - **Assert**: Verify that the HTTP response contains the success message "Successfully Uploaded File".

Validation:
  - Use the assertion to confirm that the correct success message is returned in the response, indicating a successful upload.
  - This test is crucial to ensure that the basic functionality of file uploading works correctly, which is a primary requirement for file upload features.

### Scenario 2: Missing File in Form Data

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the function when no file is submitted with the form data.

Execution:
  - **Arrange**: Create a mock HTTP request with an empty or incorrect form field name that doesn't contain "myFile". Prepare a mock HTTP response writer.
  - **Act**: Invoke `uploadFile` using the incorrect mock request and response writer.
  - **Assert**: Check that the function logs an error message indicating that the file could not be retrieved.

Validation:
  - The assertion confirms that the absence of a file in the form data is handled gracefully, without proceeding to upload operations.
  - This is important to prevent errors when users accidentally submit forms without selecting a file.

### Scenario 3: Oversized File Error

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to confirm how the function reacts when a file larger than the size limit is attempted to be uploaded.

Execution:
  - **Arrange**: Create a mock HTTP request containing a file size larger than 10 MB. Prepare a mock HTTP response writer.
  - **Act**: Call the `uploadFile` with the oversized file request and response writer.
  - **Assert**: Ensure that an appropriate error message is logged, and the HTTP status reflects an internal server error or file size error.

Validation:
  - This test ensures that size limitations are enforced, protecting server resources and application integrity by rejecting oversized files.

### Scenario 4: File Writing Error

Details:
  Description: This test examines the function's response when the server is unable to create a destination file successfully.

Execution:
  - **Arrange**: Simulate a condition where the `os.Create` function fails, such as insufficient permissions or invalid file path. Prepare required mocks.
  - **Act**: Execute the `uploadFile` function with these conditions.
  - **Assert**: Check whether the response status code is set to `http.StatusInternalServerError`, and the function correctly returns an error message.

Validation:
  - The assertion tests that `os.Create` failures are detected, ensuring robustness against server-side file storage issues.
  - This test is critical to manage situations where file system limitations or errors occur.

### Scenario 5: Empty File Upload

Details:
  Description: This test investigates the behavior when an empty file is uploaded.

Execution:
  - **Arrange**: Create a mock HTTP request with a file field having an empty content. Prepare a mock HTTP response writer.
  - **Act**: Run the `uploadFile` with the mocked data.
  - **Assert**: Validate that the response still indicates a success or handles the case specially by checking the response message or logs.

Validation:
  - It ensures that the application handles empty files gracefully while allowing the test to highlight potential user experience issues.
  - This test examines if the application provides useful feedback to the user when they unintentionally upload empty files. 

These test scenarios each tackle a different aspect of the `uploadFile` function's expected behavior, providing comprehensive coverage of its operational and error-handling capabilities.
