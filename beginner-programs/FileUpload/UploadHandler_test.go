================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
Issue: The use of 'text/template' without proper context can lead to XSS if untrusted inputs are rendered. Go templates auto-escape HTML by default, but careful context management is crucial.
Solution: Confirm that all user inputs are correctly sanitized and escaped based on their context. Consider using 'html/template' which is specifically designed to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities by ensuring proper escaping.

Vulnerability: CWE-434: Unrestricted File Uploads
Issue: The 'uploadHandler' function processes file uploads but lacks checks on file types and sizes, which could allow an attacker to upload malicious files that can be executed on the server.
Solution: Implement checks to validate file types and enforce file size limits. Use a whitelist for acceptable file extensions and verify files with a secondary method (e.g., MIME type checking).

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: File handling functions do not perform validations to constrain file paths within desired directories, potentially allowing directory traversal attacks.
Solution: Restrict file paths to a specific directory using a combination of path sanitization and absolute path resolution. Use Go's 'filepath.Clean' and 'filepath.Join' functions to mitigate directory traversal vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The POST request for file uploads lacks CSRF protection, making it susceptible to unauthorized actions if exploited.
Solution: Implement CSRF tokens to protect against unauthorized state-changing actions. Ensure each session has a unique, server-side generated token that is required with form submissions to validate requests.

================================================================================
```
Scenario 1: Handling GET request successfully displays the upload page.

Details:
  Description: This test checks if a GET request to the uploadHandler correctly triggers the display function to render the "upload" page template.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the http.ResponseWriter and prepare an HTTP request with the "GET" method.
  Act: Call uploadHandler with the mocked response writer and request.
  Assert: Ensure that the display function is called with the correct template name, "upload".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures the method branching correctly directs GET requests to the display function. This is crucial as displaying the correct page is a primary user interaction scenario.

Scenario 2: Handling POST request triggers file upload function.

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that a POST request to uploadHandler results in invoking the uploadFile function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the http.ResponseWriter and prepare an HTTP request with the "POST" method.
  Act: Call uploadHandler with the mocked response writer and request.
  Assert: Verify that uploadFile is called with the correct arguments.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies the proper execution flow for POST requests, ensuring user-uploaded files are processed as expected, which is critical for the application's file handling functionality.

Scenario 3: Unsupported HTTP method properly handled.

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that HTTP methods other than GET or POST are not mishandled and do not lead to unwanted behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the http.ResponseWriter and prepare an HTTP request with an unsupported method like "PUT".
  Act: Call uploadHandler with the mocked response writer and request.
  Assert: Check that the response status code is 405 Method Not Allowed or other error handling logic.
Validation:
  Ensuring unsupported methods are uniformly and correctly handled prevents unexpected application behavior and enhances security by disallowing unintended action paths.

Scenario 4: Correct response for multiple simultaneous GET requests.

Details:
  Description: Confirm that concurrent GET requests to uploadHandler each display the correct "upload" page, testing for race conditions or performance issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock multiple http.ResponseWriters and prepare multiple HTTP requests with the "GET" method invoked in parallel.
  Act: Call uploadHandler concurrently with mock responses and requests.
  Assert: Each mock should receive a call to display with the "upload" template.
Validation:
  This test checks scalability and concurrency management, important for ensuring the application's stability under load.

Scenario 5: Comprehensive response for multiple simultaneous POST requests.

Details:
  Description: Ensure that handling multiple concurrent POST requests to uploadHandler properly routes each to uploadFile without interference.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock multiple http.ResponseWriters and prepare multiple HTTP requests with the "POST" method.
  Act: Call uploadHandler concurrently with mock responses and requests.
  Assert: Each call should independently invoke uploadFile.
Validation:
  This test validates concurrent request handling, an important aspect of maintaining consistent data processing and avoiding data corruption under heavy loads.

Scenario 6: Edge case test for empty POST request body.

Details:
  Description: Test the outcome of sending a POST request with an empty body to verify the robustness of uploadFile's handling mechanism.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the http.ResponseWriter and prepare an HTTP request with an empty "POST" body.
  Act: Call uploadHandler with the mocked response writer and request.
  Assert: Ensure the response indicates an error or a specific handling path for empty payloads.
Validation:
  This test ensures the resiliency of file upload functionality and guards against cases that could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 7: Security test for large POST request payloads.

Details:
  Description: Assesses how uploadHandler handles excessively large payloads and checks for potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the http.ResponseWriter and prepare an HTTP request with a large "POST" payload.
  Act: Call uploadHandler with the mocked response writer and request.
  Assert: Validate that the response correctly identifies and manages large files, possibly with a 413 Payload Too Large response or similar.
Validation:
  It is critical for maintaining application security and performance that large payloads are managed effectively to prevent server overload or service degradation.
```

These scenarios cover the most important aspects of testing the `uploadHandler`, including basic functionality, error handling, concurrency management, and security considerations. Each is designed to ensure critical functionality behaves as expected under various conditions.
