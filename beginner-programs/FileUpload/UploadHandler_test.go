================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22
Issue: The code does not validate the file paths of uploads, which might allow path traversal attacks that read/write arbitrary files.
Solution: Sanitize and validate file paths to ensure they do not access directories outside the intended directory.

Vulnerability: CWE-116
Issue: Insufficient output sanitization can lead to XSS attacks as untrusted data might be injected into a webpage.
Solution: Use the `template.HTMLEscapeString` function to escape input before rendering it in HTML context.

Vulnerability: CWE-434
Issue: The `uploadHandler` function allows arbitrary file uploads without restrictions, potentially enabling malicious file uploads.
Solution: Implement file type validation and size limits, and store files in restrictive directories accessible only via application logic.

Vulnerability: CWE-77
Issue: Potential for command injection if user-controlled input is incorporated directly into command execution that isn't shown in this snippet but is implied by typical use cases.
Solution: Reject executing shell commands using unchecked input, or use `exec.CommandContext` with validated arguments if necessary.

================================================================================
Here are several test scenarios for the `uploadHandler` function:

---

Scenario 1: Proper Handling of GET Request

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `uploadHandler` function correctly handles a GET request by invoking the `display` function with the appropriate parameters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock HTTP request with the method set to GET. Prepare a response recorder to capture the HTTP response.
    Act: Call the `uploadHandler` function with the mock request and recorder.
    Assert: Verify that the `display` function is called with the correct template name and context.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Verifying the call to `display` ensures that the function appropriately prepares the response for a GET request, which should typically render a template.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test is crucial to ensure users can access the upload page correctly, which is necessary for the functionality of file uploads.

---

Scenario 2: Proper Handling of POST Request with Valid File Upload

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates if the `uploadHandler` processes a POST request to upload a file correctly by invoking the `uploadFile` function.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock HTTP request with the method set to POST, including a valid file in the request body. Use a response recorder to capture the HTTP response.
    Act: Invoke the `uploadHandler` with the mock request and recorder.
    Assert: Check if the `uploadFile` function is called with the correct request and response parameters.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The invocation of `uploadFile` should indicate successful handling of a file upload request.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Validating successful file uploads is fundamental, as it directly relates to the application's core functionality for processing user-provided files.

---

Scenario 3: Handling POST Request with Invalid File Upload

Details:
  Description: Ensure that `uploadHandler` gracefully handles a POST request with an invalid file or malformed request by verifying appropriate error handling.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock HTTP POST request with unsuitable file data. Set up a response recorder for capturing HTTP responses.
    Act: Call the `uploadHandler` with the mock request and recorder.
    Assert: Verify that the response contains an expected error status code or message.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Checking for error messages helps ensure the application delivers meaningful feedback for invalid uploads.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Proper error handling is essential to maintain application robustness and provide users with insights into issues during file uploads.

---

Scenario 4: Handling Unsupported HTTP Methods

Details:
  Description: Verify how `uploadHandler` reacts to unsupported HTTP methods to confirm it adheres to expected HTTP behavior standards.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare mock HTTP requests with unsupported methods like PUT or DELETE. Use a response recorder to capture results.
    Act: Trigger the `uploadHandler` function using the mock requests.
    Assert: Ensure the response includes an error status or redirects when an unsupported method is used.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Ensuring only supported methods are allowed prevents misuse and security vulnerabilities.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test is vital for security and correct API behavior, stopping attempts to exploit unsupported operations.

These scenarios cover a range of typical interactions with the `uploadHandler`, ensuring normal, erroneous, and edge-case behaviors are effectively tested.
